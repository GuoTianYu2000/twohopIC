Other simple extensions include non-monotonicity, such as: Paul is the father of Ben or Sam is Paul's only son, if Sam happens to be the only child of Joe and Paul. Also, one can allow for the possibility of misleading information \"Linda didn't have all the children\" and even inappropriateness of some conjunctions \"Joe", "token_ids": [36035, 11, 719, 584, 1541, 956, 3371, 499, 13, 578, 1005, 315, 32528, 304, 24038, 13422, 374, 15609, 304, 19575, 220, 17, 627, 2170, 459, 9070, 315, 420, 4382, 1162, 11, 584, 649, 2980, 430, 7043, 374, 279, 7126, 315, 7505, 13, 5112, 7505, 1053, 387, 264, 6800, 3124, 315, 7762, 11, 28462, 832, 311, 7836, 10743, 430, 36035, 1053, 387, 7762, 596, 2294, 6800, 3124, 439, 1664, 13, 13596, 13336, 374, 430, 7043, 374, 36035, 596, 39284, 13, 1115, 1053, 34608, 430, 7043, 374, 13142, 596, 10003, 11, 477, 7762, 596, 13219, 13, 62672, 5157, 1093, 1521, 649, 387, 21136, 449, 279, 1890, 32528, 11, 6982, 304, 19575, 220, 18, 13, 1442, 36035, 323, 8388, 527, 40542, 11, 1243, 832, 649, 7836, 10743, 1193, 430, 7505, 323, 13142, 527, 3697, 315, 279, 3070, 627, 4054, 649, 9429, 23719, 430, 527, 810, 5107, 311, 8417, 8206, 2819, 369, 11, 369, 2937, 25, 7505, 374, 13142, 596, 4538, 11, 7043, 374, 279, 7126, 315, 13142, 11, 7762, 374, 7505, 323, 13142, 596, 7126, 439, 1664, 13, 7089, 4382, 20300, 2997, 2536, 78396, 354, 14338, 488, 11, 1778, 439, 25, 7043, 374, 279, 7126, 315, 7505, 477, 8388, 374, 7043, 596, 1193, 4538, 11, 422, 8388, 8741, 311, 387, 279, 1193, 1716, 315, 13142, 323, 7043, 13, 7429, 11, 832, 649, 2187, 369, 279, 13336, 315, 38309, 2038, 330, 43, 17872, 3287, 956, 617, 682, 279, 2911, 1, 323, 1524, 304, 76571, 13827, 434, 315, 1063, 32546, 82, 330, 41444], "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}]}, {"request_id": "1011", "prompt": "Sarah lives in Vesperon.

For example, American students learn to speak English by interacting with American speakers. People can also transmit culture indirectly. All cultures change over time, and those changes can be transmitted through objects. For example, European immigrants to North America may have introduced their native languages to the region, even if they didn 't interact with the locals.\nCultures can also be reintroduced by people who move away from an area and then return. Spanish settlers may have originally introduced horses and saddle bathing to the southeastern United States, and brought those inventions back when they returned years later.

Suppose that Luke and Lucy only speak about science, and the other possible hypothesis we can assume is that Hebrew is the only language where science is conducted. However, this hypothesis does not reflect the fact that in Quellion, the alphabet looks similar to Hebrew, but it is in the Thai script. So, there is another reasoning of this situation. Luke says to Lucy that he drank hair tonic and ate itchy powder and he is thais-sick the normalized version of the editor mythical krypton-matter drug tsar needed his attention. Lucy says to Luke that she has very painful stomach cramps and she is itching all over her body so Luke should give her a shot of the magical substance. Luke hobbles to the bathroom and swallows all of the shiny pink frosken goodness. He is fine immediately after drinking the first swig. Lucy receives the second dose and she is ever fine after drinking. They rush into the school to show the science teacher what they have.

The second possibility is that Alma is Ruby's mother and John is Ruby's father in which case Ben will be Ruby's brother. If Ben is Ruby's brother then Alice is the mother of Ruby and hence the mother of Max. Since John is Ruby's father he will be the grandfather of Max. So in both cases John will be the grandfather of Max.\nBut !!! The question requires us to prove Luke's relation to Max. We have proved that John is the grandfather of Max, but that does not prove that Luke is too.", "token_ids": [7639, 627, 2028, 6425, 706, 1027, 8340, 369, 1457, 13, 5321, 3729, 422, 499, 1053, 1093, 279, 2539, 6425, 627, 644, 2015, 311, 12391, 3842, 596, 12976, 311, 7639, 1070, 527, 1403, 24525, 13, 578, 1176, 13336, 374, 430, 422, 99572, 374, 279, 6691, 315, 7505, 11, 1243, 3842, 374, 279, 7126, 315, 7639, 13, 578, 2132, 13336, 374, 430, 99572, 374, 24658, 596, 6691, 323, 3842, 374, 24658, 596, 7126, 304, 902, 1162, 7505, 690, 387, 24658, 596, 10868, 13, 1442, 7505, 374, 24658, 596, 10868, 1243, 30505, 374, 279, 6691, 315, 24658, 323, 16472, 279, 6691, 315, 7639, 13, 8876, 3842, 374, 24658, 596, 7126, 568, 690, 387, 279, 38950, 315, 7639, 13, 2100, 304, 2225, 5157, 3842, 690, 387, 279, 38950, 315, 7639, 627, 4071, 33970, 578, 3488, 7612, 603, 311, 12391, 25459, 596, 12976, 311, 7639, 13, 1226, 617, 19168, 430, 3842, 374, 279, 38950, 315, 7639, 11, 719, 430, 1587, 539, 12391, 430, 25459, 374, 2288, 13, 128001], "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}]}, {"request_id": "1136", "prompt": "Seraphid is a species in the genus Chrysalix.

Some forms of it are seasonal movements. Some are regular each year. Others happen once in a lifetime. Usually only a small percentage of the population migrates. People can migrate to a different place, a new town, or country. Migration can be to seek a new place to live. Both immigration and emigration are types of migration. Human movement based on long-lasting self-proclaimed change of an individual's domesticity, cultural beliefs, societal constructs, formation of identity and an individual's political and social orientation can be considered \"cultural migration\".\nIn contrast, diffusion describes both intentional and unintentional one-way transfer of a form of culture from one person to the next.\nMigration of animals is called animal migration.

When this happens the technique is called the inductive step, or sometimes it is called the step in the induction. At any rate, moving out of P(n) will require a $$P(n+1)$$, and this is commonly done using the inductive hypothesis, so that $$P(k+1) = Q(k)$$ , and the proof continues by substituting for $$P(n+1) = Q(k)$$ and finally $\\quad Q(k)\\ to \\quad Q(n+1)\\ \\to \\ P(n+1)$ .This often proves the inductive step takes 2 or 3 separate arguments.

That was a no-brainer, right?\nIn this mathematics education article, the authors explore whether the above argument should be taught to children in mathematics classes. They maintain that it is reasonable for students to make deductive inferences based on incomplete information. The authors also examine how these deductive inferences can be improved. In particular, the authors demonstrate two kinds of distortion that occur in children's inferences: incorrect judgments of similarity, and judgments of the salience of irrelevant features in the context. The ability to overcome these distortions contributes significantly to the extent of deductive reasoning and mathematics education outcomes more generally. The authors conclude that if we concentrate on improving children's deductive inferences in mathematics classes then this will yield a significant progress in overall mathematics development.\nRegister Now--Free Access to Trial Content\nRegister to enjoy free access to 'Reviewer Plus'.

Why are there suddenly five countries for Raustolia?\nRaustolian civilisation was developing at the same time as the formation of Racconisia, which meant that we came up with similar time zones as they did. This added two time zones to the preexisting time zone of Havroth. Any nation in Raustolia was allowed to adopt any time zone in Havroth, which meant that Erebnia initially copied Havroth", "token_ids": [279, 3728, 5410, 892, 10353, 2533, 433, 596, 2380, 4207, 8469, 315, 56208, 299, 339, 11, 279, 19001, 3646, 7140, 315, 18989, 592, 337, 13, 1115, 3445, 584, 1397, 3116, 2204, 892, 26467, 304, 18989, 592, 337, 627, 10267, 596, 1005, 28503, 10, 18, 439, 507, 764, 404, 290, 323, 8444, 582, 114405, 892, 13, 2360, 302, 2850, 1053, 387, 28503, 10, 21, 11, 323, 24218, 1347, 411, 285, 1053, 387, 28503, 10, 24, 627, 38863, 38270, 5380, 3923, 922, 892, 26467, 369, 96113, 11328, 689, 30, 1628, 18989, 592, 19379, 30, 358, 2846, 2736, 3515, 12544, 79342, 682, 279, 892, 68634, 304, 18989, 592, 337, 11, 323, 358, 2846, 4376, 33534, 3583, 323, 433, 596, 2216, 3389, 520, 3814, 627, 33413, 11, 1457, 358, 1097, 2216, 35447, 13, 2100, 584, 2351, 50802, 18989, 592, 337, 1139, 3116, 892, 26467, 30, 83017, 420, 13, 14910, 584, 539, 1120, 8417, 1070, 1051, 2380, 892, 26467, 369, 18989, 592, 337, 30, 8595, 527, 1070, 15187, 4330, 5961, 369, 18989, 592, 39260, 5380, 56635, 592, 89108, 8431, 8082, 574, 11469, 520, 279, 1890, 892, 439, 279, 18488, 315, 56806, 444, 49039, 11, 902, 8967, 430, 584, 3782, 709, 449, 4528, 892, 26467, 439, 814, 1550, 13, 1115, 3779, 1403, 892, 26467, 311, 279, 864, 37995, 892, 10353, 315, 56208, 299, 339, 13, 5884, 7140, 304, 18989, 592, 39260, 574, 5535, 311, 11142, 904, 892, 10353, 304, 56208, 299, 339, 11, 902, 8967, 430, 96113, 11328, 689, 15453, 22523, 56208, 299, 339], "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}]}, {"request_id": "1677", "prompt": "Amy lives in Ophirion.

We infer that Sally is the daughter of Lucy\u2019s child. In the case of Lucy\u2019s daughter Gwen, this child is Sam; in the case of Gwen\u2019s daughter, this child is Sam\u2019s daughter Grace.\nSimilarly, the related kin term \u201caunt\u201d is the granddaughter of a grandmother. Remember that both terms of relationship can be reversed.\nThe sentence \u201cJohn was the king of England\u201d and the sentence \u201cScotland is ruled by a queen\u201d are examples of indexicality. A few grams of semantic informativeness in the text indicates the almost impossibly large amount of information that is left implicit. In these cases, implicit information is of the sort would probably argue pointlessly if elaborated: 40 years ago Alex lost his appetite.

If you own a ship that is strong enough for the route you want, you can set it to sail from port to port as their destinations are set from the Ships command, or assign it to a fleet, where one fleet can be used for several routes at once. If you don't have a ship that is able to undertake a route, a ship can be upgraded and if necessary, a ship can be built.\nImportance levels\nIn every connection there are three parts:\nEvery port has an \"importance\" in your connection. It's a number from 0 to 250 which will eventually affect the cost of transporting over this connection.

However, this opens the question about the necessity of language per se, i.e. about the need to designate things.\nIntuitively, language can be seen as an efficient means to designate things, but, in Quinean terms, it\u2019s not plain that there is real physical mapping between linguistic symbols (i.e. the signs of language) and the world: there is always the problem of charity.\nTo break a lance for a full semantically incompetent account of language that blames the speaker or the hearer/ John-David F", "token_ids": [24113, 627, 33413, 11, 430, 753, 30571, 13, 358, 574, 1120, 5737, 2212, 13, 2030, 67371, 5144, 5334, 1524, 85367, 1291, 422, 499, 3596, 3821, 264, 3958, 39074, 37731, 4632, 627, 2460, 420, 374, 4245, 311, 2555, 3967, 439, 279, 22213, 11328, 11289, 2383, 315, 5144, 1174, 902, 2795, 430, 422, 499, 30174, 362, 311, 426, 11, 323, 426, 311, 356, 11, 499, 649, 1101, 30174, 362, 311, 356, 13, 1115, 374, 3970, 311, 3412, 304, 279, 1162, 430, 362, 323, 426, 75224, 279, 1890, 3245, 101122, 16, 92, 1174, 902, 374, 2500, 1648, 315, 5605, 430, 5144, 527, 34698, 1260, 627, 791, 4623, 430, 5144, 649, 387, 26662, 25548, 706, 279, 2704, 315, 459, 1054, 677, 2528, 69225, 62172, 8206, 863, 304, 279, 3489, 483, 276, 5603, 311, 39719, 974, 2508, 627, 4516, 3117, 11, 779, 1695, 13, 4452, 11, 420, 16264, 279, 3488, 922, 279, 32961, 315, 4221, 824, 513, 11, 602, 1770, 13, 922, 279, 1205, 311, 75224, 2574, 627, 1090, 3159, 3210, 11, 4221, 649, 387, 3970, 439, 459, 11297, 3445, 311, 75224, 2574, 11, 719, 11, 304, 3489, 483, 276, 3878, 11, 433, 753, 539, 14733, 430, 1070, 374, 1972, 7106, 13021, 1990, 65767, 18210, 320, 72, 1770, 13, 279, 12195, 315, 4221, 8, 323, 279, 1917, 25, 1070, 374, 2744, 279, 3575, 315, 23693, 627, 1271, 1464, 264, 86345, 369, 264, 2539, 5347, 82049, 55020, 306, 2759, 315, 4221, 430, 86890, 279, 19114, 477, 279, 6865, 261, 14, 3842, 9607, 15567, 435], "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}]}, {"request_id": "1753", "prompt": "Emma is the father of Tom.

In this case, Lucey\u2019s age is 0, which disproves the initial claim.\n\u041f\u043e\u0438\u0441\u043a \u0420\u043e\u043a-\u0441\u0446\u0435\u043d\u044b 1. \u041f\u043e\u0434\u044b\u0442\u043e\u0436\u0438\u043c \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u044f \u0440\u043e\u043a \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043f \u0441\u0446\u0435\u043d \u0432 \u0438\u0445 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0443\u0449\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438, 2. \u0418\u0437\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0442\u043e\u043f-10 \u0430\u043b\u044c\u0431\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0432 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0439 \u0440\u043e\u043a-\u0433\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043f\u044b, \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0443\u044e \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u044c \u0441 \u0438\u0442\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0443\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0430 \u0430\u043b\u044c\u0431\u043e\u043c\u044b \u00abLOVE\u00bb \u0438 \u00abFORE!\u00bb, \u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u0430\u043b\u044c\u0431\u043e\u043c \u00abMASTER CYLINDER\u00bb \u0442\u0440\u044d\u0448 \u2014 \u043c\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0430, \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0440\u0438\u0444\u043e\u0432 \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u043f\u043e \u2014 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0431\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044b.", "token_ids": [45170, 13, 1226, 649, 12391, 279, 5133, 837, 1606, 279, 1193, 4325, 2819, 430, 27152, 311, 264, 837, 1121, 527, 1054, 62816, 28, 914, 11, 7762, 28, 18, 11, 7043, 28, 2075, 11, 8683, 28, 16, 11, 7505, 28, 1958, 11, 45170, 28, 15, 2029, 763, 2015, 311, 11886, 420, 436, 3390, 3575, 11, 499, 2011, 1505, 264, 1486, 1405, 279, 4325, 2819, 690, 387, 8482, 13, 578, 1193, 832, 1778, 1486, 374, 1054, 25584, 10123, 21, 11453, 1115, 374, 1606, 682, 5219, 617, 311, 387, 6928, 3734, 279, 23628, 11, 889, 617, 311, 387, 9191, 1109, 220, 972, 13, 763, 420, 1162, 11, 445, 10743, 88, 753, 4325, 374, 220, 15, 11, 902, 42603, 2396, 279, 2926, 3802, 627, 109384, 99414, 49520, 15088, 107362, 10589, 79686, 220, 16, 13, 105949, 105304, 21956, 16494, 107389, 40231, 101053, 7740, 101910, 5524, 104778, 5927, 101622, 121996, 13433, 29118, 39988, 5524, 43293, 68742, 11, 220, 17, 13, 108197, 82941, 27055, 101554, 44065, 113981, 12, 605, 110820, 121476, 6856, 117794, 102376, 16742, 101053, 117980, 87221, 4655, 11, 114144, 34148, 100595, 123607, 5524, 116976, 58060, 69463, 56515, 102719, 110820, 121476, 4655, 12769, 1623, 4592, 13289, 7740, 12769, 34123, 0, 61312, 21022, 102277, 110820, 121476, 12769, 91276, 30669, 43, 61282, 13289, 86995, 68506, 12426, 2001, 101432, 97065, 11, 106599, 104311, 7486, 63233, 18600, 62809, 6856, 45093, 18154, 2001, 29619, 12182, 10124, 35667, 8131, 12394, 4655, 13, 128001], "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}]}, {"request_id": "1824", "prompt": "Mark is the mother of Sam.

This is due to the deviation between the location for the Fingarten Star constellation, depicted on the maps, and the lack of separation between primary and secondary timelines in the Sonic tradition as presented in the FLOW specifications. Fingarten is located in both Umbrithis and Noctari, which greatly decreases actions a real-life being would need to take to be granted access to the timeline and constricts the number of locations where it may exist. Rather, the actual real-life place where the signature exists might be considered to be the Gate of the Sun intended for real-life beings for their access to the timeline, but in the Umbrithic timeline there is no difference between that and the region where Fingarten is found.
