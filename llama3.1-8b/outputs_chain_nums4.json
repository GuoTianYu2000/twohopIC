Or, depending on whether you're on Quellion (3 hours ahead of Solmyra) or Glacidae Ophirion (which creates a time difference of Black and White +Nyx, three hours ahead of Eryndor), you add three hours to the Vall\u00e9erean Prime (+3\"), and add on the hours and minutes in just the same way as above.\nIt should be noted that the Vall\u00e9erean Clock runs in seconds, and thus is primarily not useful for keeping track of time with the Vall\u00e9erean Clock hands.

(Inspired mostly by the clock Astray encounters integral to the Rookmanium) It is secondary to the chronograph found on the Vesperon Clock.\nVesperon is actually the only country that actually uses the Vall\u00e9erean Prime to being the time with a zero seconds; since the Vall\u00e9erean Clock runs in seconds, this makes for easier tracking of events.\nThis page was last modified on 24 September 2017, at 21:16.", "token_ids": [469, 894, 303, 269, 320, 11536, 650, 70138, 263, 374, 220, 18, 4207, 8469, 315, 3489, 616, 290, 323, 3489, 616, 290, 374, 220, 18, 4207, 8469, 315, 469, 894, 303, 269, 4390, 791, 79763, 978, 486, 276, 27234, 649, 387, 743, 1403, 5627, 25, 832, 374, 311, 743, 433, 311, 279, 79763, 978, 486, 276, 12801, 11, 902, 374, 13890, 311, 25497, 320, 15, 4063, 323, 1243, 923, 389, 279, 4207, 320, 19070, 291, 555, 4520, 3347, 279, 6596, 8, 5995, 311, 5625, 1148, 499, 1390, 311, 79763, 978, 486, 276, 892, 13, 2582, 11, 11911, 389, 3508, 499, 2351, 389, 3489, 616, 290, 320, 18, 4207, 8469, 315, 11730, 2465, 969, 8, 477, 8444, 582, 114405, 507, 764, 404, 290, 320, 8370, 11705, 264, 892, 6811, 315, 5348, 323, 5929, 489, 99192, 87, 11, 2380, 4207, 8469, 315, 469, 894, 303, 269, 705, 499, 923, 2380, 4207, 311, 279, 79763, 978, 486, 276, 12801, 18457, 18, 4063, 323, 923, 389, 279, 4207, 323, 4520, 304, 1120, 279, 1890, 1648, 439, 3485, 627, 2181, 1288, 387, 10555, 430, 279, 79763, 978, 486, 276, 27234, 8640, 304, 6622, 11, 323, 8617, 374, 15871, 539, 5505, 369, 10494, 3839, 315, 892, 449, 279, 79763, 978, 486, 276, 27234, 6206, 13, 578, 79763, 978, 486, 276, 27234, 1450, 374, 1766, 304, 279, 20638, 83283, 11, 323, 574, 1193, 36592, 264, 2478, 2919, 3347, 279, 330, 5040, 455, 1, 315, 279, 6376, 13, 320, 29356, 2740, 433, 574, 36592, 555, 48035, 13616, 11, 719, 3821, 36024, 3217, 4024, 311, 452, 867, 6091, 570, 1115, 9042, 34555, 1555, 6622, 25, 220, 4119, 311, 220, 26513, 13, 320, 74640, 2757, 10213, 555, 279, 9042, 39616, 352, 35006, 26154, 311, 279, 432, 1982, 1543, 2411, 8, 1102, 374, 14580, 311, 279, 27076, 3257, 1766, 389, 279, 650, 70138, 263, 27234, 627, 53, 70138, 263, 374, 3604, 279, 1193, 3224, 430, 3604, 5829, 279, 79763, 978, 486, 276, 12801, 311, 1694, 279, 892, 449, 264, 7315, 6622, 26, 2533, 279, 79763, 978, 486, 276, 27234, 8640, 304, 6622, 11, 420, 3727, 369, 8831, 15194, 315, 4455, 627, 2028, 2199, 574, 1566, 11041, 389, 220, 1187, 6250, 220, 679, 22, 11, 520, 220, 1691, 25, 845, 13, 128001], "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}]}, {"request_id": "3004", "prompt": "Ophirion follows the time zone of Balthorien.

Since each statement only tells us one person is the father of a specific person, all of the other people in the statement must be different members of the family tree. Let's look at this using the points of the circle. The question is one that tells us something we don't know. Therefore, it must be a property of the circle, or a special point of the circle. We have various points in the drawing to help us to know the relationship between the various people pointed out in the statement. We can tell that Ruby will be a part of a crown. If she is the father of Tom, then she must be under one of the crowns. Because the circled statement tells us that we do not know the gender of one of the people, there is an orange marking. This indeterminate fact means that either Ruby's son or Ruby's child could be up above Ruby. Since Ruby is under the crown, then the orange mark tells us that if it is not up above Ruby, the opposite side must be Ruby's which is up under the crown. Tom is under the blue arrow which denotes a step son. We know that Ruby is under the red arrow. Since Amy is the father of Ruby, there must be a line connecting the two. This creates a crown with Ruby and Amy. Since Amy is connected to the crowns with Ruby, we can safely say that Amy must be connected to the crowns with any members of the family tree who are connected to Ruby, whether they are directly connected or are connected on the other side of Ruby. Therefore we know that Amy is connected to the crowns with Anna, Alice, and Emma. Using propositional logic we know that because Amy is connected to all of the points in either circle, if we find a point that is called in another relation or has someone in another relation's crown, then Amy must also be in that relation or have that person's crown.\nAlison is a what?\nThe Earth from space has three types of movement.\nMonica gives Gina $60 in", "token_ids": [7043, 627, 791, 3488, 364, 76109, 374, 279, 38950, 315, 7043, 6, 374, 2555, 430, 6835, 499, 264, 31089, 922, 279, 12135, 1990, 1274, 389, 279, 3070, 5021, 13, 8876, 1855, 5224, 1193, 10975, 603, 832, 1732, 374, 279, 7126, 315, 264, 3230, 1732, 11, 682, 315, 279, 1023, 1274, 304, 279, 5224, 2011, 387, 2204, 3697, 315, 279, 3070, 5021, 13, 6914, 596, 1427, 520, 420, 1701, 279, 3585, 315, 279, 12960, 13, 578, 3488, 374, 832, 430, 10975, 603, 2555, 584, 1541, 956, 1440, 13, 15636, 11, 433, 2011, 387, 264, 3424, 315, 279, 12960, 11, 477, 264, 3361, 1486, 315, 279, 12960, 13, 1226, 617, 5370, 3585, 304, 279, 13633, 311, 1520, 603, 311, 1440, 279, 5133, 1990, 279, 5370, 1274, 14618, 704, 304, 279, 5224, 13, 1226, 649, 3371, 430, 24658, 690, 387, 264, 961, 315, 264, 27631, 13, 1442, 1364, 374, 279, 7126, 315, 8529, 11, 1243, 1364, 2011, 387, 1234, 832, 315, 279, 9460, 4511, 13, 9393, 279, 4319, 839, 5224, 10975, 603, 430, 584, 656, 539, 1440, 279, 10026, 315, 832, 315, 279, 1274, 11, 1070, 374, 459, 19087, 36024, 13, 1115, 1280, 65324, 2144, 3445, 430, 3060, 24658, 596, 4538, 477, 24658, 596, 1716, 1436, 387, 709, 3485, 24658, 13, 8876, 24658, 374, 1234, 279, 27631, 11, 1243, 279, 19087, 1906, 10975, 603, 430, 422, 433, 374, 539, 709, 3485, 24658, 11, 279, 14329, 3185, 2011, 387, 24658, 596, 902, 374, 709, 1234, 279, 27631, 13, 8529, 374, 1234, 279, 6437, 18404, 902, 72214, 264, 3094, 4538, 13, 1226, 1440, 430, 24658, 374, 1234, 279, 2579, 18404, 13, 8876, 29793, 374, 279, 7126, 315, 24658, 11, 1070, 2011, 387, 264, 1584, 21583, 279, 1403, 13, 1115, 11705, 264, 27631, 449, 24658, 323, 29793, 13, 8876, 29793, 374, 8599, 311, 279, 9460, 4511, 449, 24658, 11, 584, 649, 21676, 2019, 430, 29793, 2011, 387, 8599, 311, 279, 9460, 4511, 449, 904, 3697, 315, 279, 3070, 5021, 889, 527, 8599, 311, 24658, 11, 3508, 814, 527, 6089, 8599, 477, 527, 8599, 389, 279, 1023, 3185, 315, 24658, 13, 15636, 584, 1440, 430, 29793, 374, 8599, 311, 279, 9460, 4511, 449, 24101, 11, 30505, 11, 323, 36035, 13, 12362, 10045, 3079, 12496, 584, 1440, 430, 1606, 29793, 374, 8599, 311, 682, 315, 279, 3585, 304, 3060, 12960, 11, 422, 584, 1505, 264, 1486, 430, 374, 2663, 304, 2500, 12976, 477, 706, 4423, 304, 2500, 12976, 596, 27631, 11, 1243, 29793, 2011, 1101, 387, 304, 430, 12976, 477, 617, 430, 1732, 596, 27631, 627, 2149, 3416, 374, 264, 1148, 5380, 791, 9420, 505, 3634, 706, 2380, 4595, 315, 7351, 627, 11342, 3074, 6835, 77312, 400, 1399, 304], "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}]}, {"request_id": "3009", "prompt": "Sarah is the father of Sam.

Jack\u2019s parents and grandparents are both parallel. The middle three couples are also parallel. Any first grandmother-grandfather pair also creates a parallel couple, as when looking at the relatives from a tree\u2019s bottom, they can all be parallel.\nWhat is the relationship of Sam and Max?\nIf you aren\u2019t comfortable with induction, then you can use symmetry and think about how the relationships between the pairs apply. Because they form a loop, the grandmothers and the parents change places between each step, and this applies to all the family pairs. The one consistent pair of a mother and grandmother, done in parallel, will not work.\nHow to correctly identify the target couples\nThe given information in the question mentions several key relationships. It also repeats four couples: Sam and Anna, Joe and Anna, Luke and Kate, and the two connecting couples (Ruby and Joe, Joe and Jack). This effectively says that the first two pairs, combined with one of the connectors, produce the next connector. Since we\u2019re missing Ruby, we can assume that she\u2019s the first, and that Alice, Alex, and Kate are the ends of the chain.\nThe stage can be described as a series of steps where in each step one pair is created by combining two existing pairs. The first step is to put down the opposite ends (Alice and Alex) and Sam and Joe together. The second step will produce Max. The third step will produce the final couple, which uncountably moves around if you try to actively compute its values, as the values for everyone else cannot be deduced without Ruby.\nAll finalists have a first cousin\nA surprising result is that all of the Wallace men have a first cousin, which is the connection between them. A cousin is someone to whom a person is related through one of their parents. So Alice (the smart one) and Joe (the one who has a sense of humor) are second cousins-in-law to Kate and Jack, but first cousin to each other.

Therefore, Joe speaks German. Therefore, Alice speaks Swedish.\nWhich argument, if valid, would not be used to justify the missing conclusion being true?\nFragile Values (a.k.a. Burden of Proof) It's easy to justify a conclusion with an argument. It's easy to claim that an argument is \"valid\". But validity is like Fragile values (a. cont.) It's easy to justify a conclusion with an argument. It's easy to claim that an argument is \"valid\". But validity is like Fragile. It is very difficult to disprove a valid argument. It's very easy to invalidate an invalid argument, but often, difficult to prove that an argument is valid. Karl Popper presented an epistemological solution in \"Conjectures and Refutations\". An argument will be classified as either \"falsifiable\" or \"infalsifiable\". An argument is Valid or Invalid, even if it appears to be infalsifiable. If an author fails to include all know facts about the subject, he will respond to queries with spin or silence. This creates a massive opportunity for proliferating spin, because if all too many of us accept the spin or declare ourselves satisfied with the silence, we essentially become informed by that lousy argument. I may accept a valid argument that didn't include compelling facts. I may be persuaded by an infalsifiable argument. The principle here is Fragile. For example, if we take the Magnum opus cross-reference in which an author refutes DA by claiming Simplicity of reference to imply variety of reference, we don't not know if the Fellow is actually entitled to use that claim. if no one knows the answer, and no one queries the author, the falsehood becomes a principal dogma.

In 2003, an Ohio court (while reviewing a couple's belongings) applied the \"community standard of living\" (also known as life-style/personality view) for dividing the assets. In 1993, the court refused to divide the assets based on a cohabitation agreement.\nThen, in 2013, an Ohio court split assets based on their own impression of how the couple spent their time. In 2018, a Pennsylvania court made a similar decision.\nWay back in March 2007 , society-wise moved on abit to the Ohio Community State-of-Living Rule. Therefore, in February 2019 (with the release of \" White Torture \" by Joy Kogawa) I created the \" Cohabitation Agreement \" for splitting assets between unmarried people.\nNow, over a decade later, society is starting to take note of split-decisions in Ohio and Pennsylvania courts. Therefore, society has moved on to Cohabitation Agreements (and Away from the Status Quo Rules).\nWay back in Nov 2007, I started teaching in society. Way back in 2016, I retired from society.

Borithis directly inherits the features of Xyphodon. Thus, Borithis is thicker than Xyphodon. Therefore, statement (2) follows from the statements (1) and (3). Dranthidae is a species of the same family in which Zephyra, as Kryestosidae \u2192 Zephyras \u2192 Sicanthas \u2192 Dranthidae. Dranthidae directly inherits the characteristics of Zephyra; thus, Dranthidae is thinner than Zephyra. Myralin is a genus in a family, and Phoriidae. Therefore, Yvorith is a species in a genus in a family classified under Phorvian as follows: Phoriidae \u2192 Myralin \u2192 Yvorith. Therefore, statement (2) is correct and thus option (a) is the correct answer.\nIf (a + 4 + b) (c + 2 +d) = 40, find the value of (b + c + d)\nA man posing for a picture with a model explained, \u201cThe ratio of my age and my wife two years ago is 1 : 3 and the ratio of my age and my daughter one year ago was 3 : 1.

Various people figure in this classification, some of whom have more than one name. At the end of three generations of tracing this genealogical tree, we arrive at a certain person (Max), whose parent is also a figure in this classification (Mark). On the other hand, it is seen that Luke (another figure in this classification) is also the grandfather of Max. It is exactly this kind of thinking that we would employ when we answer this question about the relationship between Luke and Jack.\nConsider the algebraic illustration below, which presents a similar family tree:\nIn the above figure, the line of inheritance can be captured by the arcs from parents to children -- these can be considered as statements of the form 'X is the Y of Z'. We can then construct a table of relationships corresponding to the above family tree:\nNow, we consider statements pertaining to certain relations. Thus, in the statement, 'X is the\n'father' of Y, X is the parent of Y. A statement like 'Y is the\n'father' of A is a logical contradiction. If X is the\n'mother' of Y, then Y is the\n'child' of X. Note that a person can be at the same time both the\n'mother' and\n'child' of itself. Further, observe that although cascade and horizon statements are statements of the form 'X is the Y of Z', interactive statements cannot be so expressed. An interactive statement can be reduced to a non-interactive statement -- for example, the statement,\n'M is the niece of J12' can be reduced to 'H is the parent of I and I is the parent of J12'.

Garfidar is part of the country Tyseria. Therefore, Rufus Galdon is located in the larger country rather than the smaller. If the city is part of an independent state, then it is part of two or more forms of government.\nHow may I help you? What you are getting at or addressing, is so minuscule and abstract? May I ask- Why does Quellion not recognize either Havroth, Marendor, Zorvath, Tyseria or Tyrantha as formally recognized independent states? What about Eryndor, and Xyphodon?\nRefer to the links in the wiki. Havroth and Garfidar have been through various change in their statuses. Marendor is a colony, the one at least they rule over, and Garfidar isn't a colony of Havroth. Tyseria itself is under the control of two different alliances, and various countries and cities are part of Tyseria. Havroth does not control or rule over them. How can Havroth be formally recognized as a state when Havroth is an unrecognized state, not allied with any recognized countries, and only controls one of its territories, with one of Havroth's two leaders imprisoned in Xyph", "token_ids": [279, 8294, 961, 315, 386, 53945, 269, 11, 323, 539, 279, 9333, 961, 482, 1901, 269, 85, 589, 13, 1901, 269, 85, 589, 374, 7559, 4871, 315, 14221, 805, 689, 11, 323, 43701, 324, 23218, 374, 961, 315, 14221, 805, 689, 13, 14221, 6713, 23218, 323, 445, 1036, 3212, 527, 5415, 304, 8444, 582, 114405, 13, 99257, 355, 480, 4852, 263, 374, 264, 3363, 304, 279, 1614, 315, 14221, 6713, 23218, 13, 3489, 616, 290, 1587, 539, 15641, 279, 2704, 315, 14221, 6713, 23218, 439, 459, 9678, 1614, 13, 19292, 11, 539, 1524, 279, 2800, 315, 56208, 299, 339, 45799, 14221, 6713, 23218, 13, 14636, 11, 14221, 6713, 23218, 374, 459, 97239, 1614, 11, 433, 1587, 539, 3073, 439, 3117, 439, 3489, 616, 290, 374, 11920, 13, 3489, 616, 290, 374, 264, 3363, 304, 386, 53945, 269, 13, 4452, 2728, 1202, 6996, 315, 18324, 439, 2225, 264, 3363, 323, 1614, 11, 15038, 3235, 279, 1584, 433, 19284, 2704, 505, 264, 3363, 311, 264, 17516, 6424, 13, 99257, 355, 480, 4852, 263, 374, 264, 3363, 304, 12471, 33539, 277, 13, 12471, 33539, 277, 374, 961, 315, 279, 3224, 14221, 805, 689, 13, 15636, 11, 99257, 355, 480, 4852, 263, 374, 7559, 304, 279, 8294, 3224, 4856, 1109, 279, 9333, 13, 1442, 279, 3363, 374, 961, 315, 459, 9678, 1614, 11, 1243, 433, 374, 961, 315, 1403, 477, 810, 7739, 315, 3109, 627, 4438, 1253, 358, 1520, 499, 30, 3639, 499, 527, 3794, 520, 477, 28118, 11, 374, 779, 1332, 26089, 1130, 323, 8278, 30, 3297, 358, 2610, 12, 8595, 1587, 3489, 616, 290, 539, 15641, 3060, 56208, 299, 339, 11, 386, 53945, 269, 11, 1901, 269, 85, 589, 11, 14221, 805, 689, 477, 14221, 6713, 23218, 439, 37402, 15324, 9678, 5415, 30, 3639, 922, 469, 894, 303, 269, 11, 323, 1630, 88, 764, 77152, 5380, 48547, 311, 279, 7902, 304, 279, 29709, 13, 56208, 299, 339, 323, 12471, 33539, 277, 617, 1027, 1555, 5370, 2349, 304, 872, 60458, 13, 386, 53945, 269, 374, 264, 42036, 11, 279, 832, 520, 3325, 814, 6037, 927, 11, 323, 12471, 33539, 277, 4536, 956, 264, 42036, 315, 56208, 299, 339, 13, 14221, 805, 689, 5196, 374, 1234, 279, 2585, 315, 1403, 2204, 70800, 11, 323, 5370, 5961, 323, 9919, 527, 961, 315, 14221, 805, 689, 13, 56208, 299, 339, 1587, 539, 2585, 477, 6037, 927, 1124, 13, 2650, 649, 56208, 299, 339, 387, 37402, 15324, 439, 264, 1614, 994, 56208, 299, 339, 374, 459, 97239, 1614, 11, 539, 54502, 449, 904, 15324, 5961, 11, 323, 1193, 11835, 832, 315, 1202, 39543, 11, 449, 832, 315, 56208, 299, 339, 596, 1403, 6164, 52942, 304, 1630, 88, 764], "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}]}, {"request_id": "3102", "prompt": "Thalorium is a species in the genus Borithis.

It floats upside down and awaits its prey. When it senses a swimmer under the ice, it will shine abundant light from its lamp to confuse its prey, making it easy to attack. Its limbs are short and narrow; this allows it to walk on the surface and to some extent to travel underwater; it can also maneuver underwater. Its hands are very strong and strong enough to grab its prey, which is usually big enough to cope with any possible escape. They also have wings on their limbs so they can fly underwater and escape from threats.\nThe species is very popular and has a population of about 100,000 in the northern hemisphere and 300,000 in the southern hemisphere. As a food source and material for ultraviolet illumination, it is very popular as an animal pet due to cheaper prices. It can also raise the body temperature in humans. Illuminations with Uthrelin are popular for anxiety and high blood pressure. When you eat your name plate, the name plate can be placed on the forehead, which can be a sign of \"I am so ugly, I don't want to see myself anymore\" and \"I want to hide forever.\"\nIt usually has a gray to dark brown body with thick black stripes on it. It has a pair of small violin-like eyes. It uses the glow from its lamp to confuse its prey. Its lamp has a rectangular shape and a surface with thousands of UV photons.\u00a0\nIt has six limbs, each of which has a wing. However, it cannot use wings to fly in air because its air passageway is a straight pipe, which is not well equipped for turning.

The king of Ytheris, Adimarakus, decided that his people are now too civilized and should appreciate nature a little bit more. In addition, subterranean colonies cannot give a man the risk of dying from heart attacks from climbing mountains.\nThis idea originates from another story I read many years ago. Dras was established as the result of this transformation. These colonies consist of strange people. Their skin is largely covered in green scales. Before I could think more, the host cut in. As a result, if I was in Balthorien, my appearance would be strange as well. The inhabitants are very mysterious as a subterranean background. Dras is also known for the black metal bands that live here. This idea brought up the question of shadow harvesting. I didn't find it surprising. The libraries are also communities that thrive on these shadow energy.\nGalleneer tells me that this scientifically advances the area massively. He is happy for the chance out of this curse. As a result, Ophirion is a place that has been chosen by the Ytheris military because of its warm climate. Kryo is a place where the literacy rate is higher than anywhere in the empire. Many people see Kryo as the center of learning policies. By this, the mold of Holies that is found on the sea floor is a commonly found mark. Then, the city was built next to the sea as every city. Elkatrix also insisted he found a D&D patron on the ocean floor.\nHe also noticed a resemblance to one of the demon lords of the Abyss.

The swords of the Ex-exterminator brace upon him, mingled with his war-hammer, and his fighting word is at the side. An extremely visionary spell is forged into the blade. Quarterstaffs true name has yet to be known by any of its servitors who may aid him, but unknown to most is that he is merely a priest of Dolth and an effective one at that. Almost demonically easy to deal with, powerful in demeanor, heavenly in stature, and devilishly cunning.

Noctari, Vesperon, and Vynora are considered \u201cforeign cities\u201d. As a neutral city, Zorvath is the least distinctive city in The Elder Scrolls world from an art design perspective. However, this city also has the longest history of all the game\u2019s cities.\nThe appearance of several buildings in Zorvath and Vinarasse reuses the entrance artwork from the Oblivion Palace. The city was reused into many other areas of the game, in general, appearing as either a nicer variant of a room in the city, or only appearing as a window-shade eyed window. An example of this, is the window-shade eyed waterwell on Zorvath\u2019s justice quarter. We then see an identical window-shade eyed waterwell in Noctari\u2019s law district. Using old unused assets was as old as a tradition as settling new lands in the game. It\u2019s definitely a pity that Zorvath was wasted in this way, because technically speaking, the city could have been better anchored. The creation of buildings, however, was good enough for the purpose it served. As for where the city is situated, it does a good job of showcasing how no city is intended to hold more than a few thousand people. Zorvath is a beautiful looking city in several areas. In both its law district and to a lesser extent, its temple district. The city sports a black gate and a white law district.\nThe city on the whole seems to reflect an order somewhat impacted by Christian thinking. This same sort of thought seems to reflect in the orator\u2019s speech of Kjofril of Vinothro, which is a quite interesting interpretation of law-based and rational thinking.\nArchitecturally, Zorvath is quite captivating. Like Jeremy Soule, who wrote music for the Drasleathe series, the priest tower in Zorvath\u2019s law district is similar to a church steep-tower in Britain. The alien central building in this area is an official building in the city.

I also included what it would look like if Havroth and Glacidae were 6 hours behind Solmyra (as Luminax and Fendrel are today).\nFurthermore, I've included a second image to show the actual border with Solmyra in red, west of which would also be the red X that represents the border with Quellion, with Havroth and Glacidae 3 hours behind Quellion, being at 9 hours behind Quellion. The 3 hours would be added to the timezone information of Havroth and Glacidae.\nIn the third chart, I show the general idea that no matter which way you name it, it is west of Quellion, with Quellion as the official timezone. Note please that Xyphodon is not the timezone of Havroth. The timezone of Havroth is merely the custom of Havroth. Xyphodon is, as always, a music reference (the band Xyphodon is listed on the page right now as being native to Havroth. They're possibly one of the few native Havrothan clans in the series. ) Therefore, the Havroths would probably add three hours to the time they heard anything telling them from Xyphodon.

Explanation The statement is true because John is the mother of Luke. Luke is the mother of Jack. Therefore, John can be the grandmother of Jack through her son, Luke.\nKate is the mother of Joanne. Susan is the mother of Karyn. Frank is the father of Karyn. Tim is the father of Joanne. Karyn is the father of Ryan. Therefore, Kate is the grandmother of Ryan. Mark is the father of George. George is the father of Julie. Carol is the mother of Julie. Mark is the father of Carol. Therefore, John is the grandfather of Julie. Mark is the father of George. George is the father of Julie. Carol is the mother of Julie. Mark is the father of Carol. Therefore, John is the grandfather of Julie. Explanation The written statement consists of the three sentences \"Kate is the mother of Joanne,\" \"Susan is the mother of Karyn,\" and \"Frank is the father of Karyn.\" It can be inferred that Karyn is the daughter of Frank and Susan. Since the statement explicitly states that Tim is the father of Joanne, it can be concluded that Tim is the husband of Kate. The statement then states that Karyn is the father of Ryan, indicating that Karyn is a nonbinary person who identifies as both a mother and a father. Finally, it is stated that John is the mother of Carol, which implies that John is a nonbinary person who identifies as both a mother and a father. Therefore, based on the given information, it can be inferred that John is the grandfather of Julie through the nonbinary parent Karyn.\nBea is the mother of Sarah. Fran is the mother of Emily. John is the father of Sam. Fran is the mother of Mark. Emily is the grandmother of Sam. Therefore, John is Sarah's father.

After throwing the ball to his son, the boy caught the ball, took a few steps back and threw the ball to his father.

In came his father's response, \"Tim - you know, you don't have to do all that.\"\nNow family life has become increasingly difficult. Mothers and fathers are deceived, exhausted, disillusioned and more cautious with their money. As an extension of this, their relationships are more distant. Widows and widowers and single parents are disheartened. They are on thin ice and lack hope.\nI remember when I was 13 years old, my mother had brain surgery. 21 years ago, my father lost consciousness in a motor vehicle accident and lay hospitalized for three weeks before we discovered that he had alcohol related encephalopathy.\nEach of those bruises had a backstory.

I would strongly suggest that you try to go even further in ascertaining that Tom is the grandfather of Alice. This is because there may be some scenario that could contradict your argument.\nFor example, there is a minor glitch in the data flow here.\nAmy is the daughter of Sam so Sam must be a grandfather, as he is an old enough father.\nGiven Sam is old enough, then Anna is the oldest person that has not figured in any of the generations between father and daughter. Anna could be:\nthe mother of the grandfather of Alice;\nthe sister of the grandfather of Alice; or\nthe aunt of the mother of Alice.\nThe only way that Sam would have Alice as his granddaughter is if he was a grandfather, and the only way he could be a grandfather is if he were an uncle who was an old enough father and then aunt of mother of granddaughter.\nTom could, but does not have to, be Alice's paternal grandfather.\nHey, thanks Dave. Good points. Really appreciate it. Look's like you got that in depth analysis down. Very intriguing stuff.\nIt's hard for me to see how Tom wouldn't be the grandfather but still - there's always that maybe.\nGlad I was able to give you a hand there :)\nHere's an updated app that includes the original 160 questions and answers along with the follow-up questions and solutions as well:\nAccording to this, if \"Elane is the husband of Ramez, and Elane's father is the husband of Zainab\" then the following question's answer would be \"No\":\nBased on this answer, Amal should have x- y generations instead of x - 1 and y. The two generations of x and y are perpendicular so they would be the two grandfathers.\nThis article is obviously pointing to something that I'm missing somewhere in the logic.\nReem, your updated argument is valid given the definition you used. I did not consider your definition, so I was working on the assumption that no husband of a grandfather can be a \"grandfather\" anymore.\nSince this definition was made by the book, then it would be", "token_ids": [30505, 627, 697, 336, 11, 499, 1614, 701, 5811, 9539, 13, 358, 1053, 16917, 4284, 430, 499, 1456, 311, 733, 1524, 4726, 304, 439, 12525, 2101, 430, 8529, 374, 279, 38950, 315, 30505, 13, 1115, 374, 1606, 1070, 1253, 387, 1063, 15398, 430, 1436, 43561, 701, 5811, 627, 2520, 3187, 11, 1070, 374, 264, 9099, 62184, 304, 279, 828, 6530, 1618, 627, 76109, 374, 279, 10003, 315, 8388, 779, 8388, 2011, 387, 264, 38950, 11, 439, 568, 374, 459, 2362, 3403, 7126, 627, 22818, 8388, 374, 2362, 3403, 11, 1243, 24101, 374, 279, 24417, 1732, 430, 706, 539, 25720, 304, 904, 315, 279, 22540, 1990, 7126, 323, 10003, 13, 24101, 1436, 387, 512, 1820, 6691, 315, 279, 38950, 315, 30505, 280, 1820, 13219, 315, 279, 38950, 315, 30505, 26, 477, 198, 1820, 51166, 315, 279, 6691, 315, 30505, 627, 791, 1193, 1648, 430, 8388, 1053, 617, 30505, 439, 813, 92490, 374, 422, 568, 574, 264, 38950, 11, 323, 279, 1193, 1648, 568, 1436, 387, 264, 38950, 374, 422, 568, 1051, 459, 38594, 889, 574, 459, 2362, 3403, 7126, 323, 1243, 51166, 315, 6691, 315, 92490, 627, 25763, 1436, 11, 719, 1587, 539, 617, 311, 11, 387, 30505, 596, 93367, 38950, 627, 19182, 11, 9523, 20851, 13, 7839, 3585, 13, 29308, 15763, 433, 13, 9372, 596, 1093, 499, 2751, 430, 304, 8149, 6492, 1523, 13, 15668, 41765, 6392, 627, 2181, 596, 2653, 369, 757, 311, 1518, 1268, 8529, 8434, 956, 387, 279, 38950, 719, 2103, 482, 1070, 596, 2744, 430, 7344, 627, 38, 18599, 358, 574, 3025, 311, 3041, 499, 264, 1450, 1070, 90163, 8586, 596, 459, 6177, 917, 430, 5764, 279, 4113, 220, 6330, 4860, 323, 11503, 3235, 449, 279, 1833, 5352, 4860, 323, 10105, 439, 1664, 512, 11439, 311, 420, 11, 422, 330, 6719, 2194, 374, 279, 10177, 315, 432, 373, 89, 11, 323, 4072, 2194, 596, 7126, 374, 279, 10177, 315, 1901, 467, 370, 1, 1243, 279, 2768, 3488, 596, 4320, 1053, 387, 330, 2822, 4764, 29815, 389, 420, 4320, 11, 3383, 278, 1288, 617, 865, 12, 379, 22540, 4619, 315, 865, 482, 220, 16, 323, 379, 13, 578, 1403, 22540, 315, 865, 323, 379, 527, 77933, 779, 814, 1053, 387, 279, 1403, 6800, 69, 19568, 627, 2028, 4652, 374, 14224, 22364, 311, 2555, 430, 358, 2846, 7554, 15038, 304, 279, 12496, 627, 697, 336, 11, 701, 6177, 5811, 374, 2764, 2728, 279, 7419, 499, 1511, 13, 358, 1550, 539, 2980, 701, 7419, 11, 779, 358, 574, 3318, 389, 279, 25329, 430, 912, 10177, 315, 264, 38950, 649, 387, 264, 330, 53766, 23881, 1, 14926, 627, 12834, 420, 7419, 574, 1903, 555, 279, 2363, 11, 1243, 433, 1053, 387], "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}]}, {"request_id": "3185", "prompt": "Vynora follows the time zone of Eryndor.

Could anyone provide an explanation for this problem using a logic diagram?... and also, is this an Islamic organization's official way to solve such things?\nThis is basically deducing. Namely, you assume that your parent is a child of someone, your grandchild is a grandchild of someone else, and you start finding out whose grandchild is each of your parents.\nI can easily say that first X is the parent of Y and third Y is the parent of H, X is a grandparent of H (btw H stands for Harry). But I don't know who is the 4th person. So let's assume that 4th is T who is also the parent of X. This conjecture doesn't lead us anywhere.\nSo let's try this: 4th is T who is also the parent of Z. Then we can deduce that Z is the parent of Y. Even better, Y is also the father of H.\nThis means our conjecture, that 4th is T' is a false conjecture. So it must be U who is the parent of Z and T' whose child is H.\nFinally we can conclude that 4th is U and Jack is the grandparent of Ruby because he's Lucy's father.\nThis problem is very similar to the following problem.

Why not follow the Xyphodon/Fendrel time zone (10AM-10PM @ Quill)? Because the two leading historians of Havroth -- Pastor Wirja Halihrund and Jarut Mogeddo, the Histographer-General -- had established the tradition in the 7th quarter of the 7th millennium by setting up their events and stories on Vesperon's time zones instead of Nivela's.\nJarut's pre-Eighth-Homeleave-gate collection of stories, passed on to him by Jarut's grandfather Aogodh who had served in the Circle of Thren, was radically arranged based on Havroth's Julian calendar (PS NNUVE). This chronology established the old Vesper of seven centuries past as having the same Sun Time influence as the New Vesper of today (millions of miles away). According to Wirja, Jarut had appointed the Restored Inner Circle to be the last stable Incendium group before the First Glaciation (2nd-3rd qtr of the 1st millennium EC), while in reality this task had been done hundreds of years earlier during the Thumb War, around the same year CC 2000 (Living Legend of DC 21).\nRegardless of what historians believe today, Jarut Mogeddo relied on a peculiar system of defining Sun Time and assigning Feast Days and seasons amongst others. His peculiar system was derived from a whole host of celestial mechanics observations from Centuries Ellipse CCT 3,983 (288,545 ET) to CCT 3,983,148 (288,569 ET). During the cartographic reconstruction phase of the Post-National Near-Universe Government Vemberum, Jarut, who had at that point became Aogodh Mogeddo's personal cartographer, developed from scratch a straight-time, straight-galaxy system of clock calibrations.\nThe system's basic fundamental", "token_ids": [386, 53945, 269, 627, 29601, 73723, 25, 41472, 41124, 11, 37832, 8942, 969, 11, 41235, 21947, 11, 74514, 67, 1994, 11, 1901, 76876, 969, 198, 10445, 1587, 34362, 38359, 57365, 1833, 279, 650, 70138, 263, 14, 2232, 616, 290, 892, 10353, 320, 21, 1428, 12, 21, 8971, 571, 32749, 278, 12106, 8595, 539, 1833, 279, 1630, 88, 764, 77152, 12598, 408, 3833, 892, 10353, 320, 605, 1428, 12, 605, 8971, 571, 3489, 484, 12106, 9393, 279, 1403, 6522, 51801, 315, 56208, 299, 339, 1198, 59766, 36003, 5697, 473, 8115, 4171, 1263, 323, 31651, 332, 61021, 291, 3055, 11, 279, 67005, 42606, 59082, 1198, 1047, 9749, 279, 14135, 304, 279, 220, 22, 339, 8502, 315, 279, 220, 22, 339, 89785, 555, 6376, 709, 872, 4455, 323, 7493, 389, 650, 70138, 263, 596, 892, 26467, 4619, 315, 452, 344, 8458, 596, 627, 72835, 332, 596, 864, 13737, 22635, 12, 7778, 22233, 2427, 349, 4526, 315, 7493, 11, 5946, 389, 311, 1461, 555, 31651, 332, 596, 38950, 362, 540, 347, 71, 889, 1047, 10434, 304, 279, 21918, 315, 666, 1466, 11, 574, 61127, 28902, 3196, 389, 56208, 299, 339, 596, 38897, 13470, 320, 5119, 452, 4013, 4592, 570, 1115, 27076, 2508, 9749, 279, 2362, 650, 70138, 315, 8254, 24552, 3347, 439, 3515, 279, 1890, 8219, 4212, 10383, 439, 279, 1561, 650, 70138, 315, 3432, 320, 26064, 919, 315, 8931, 3201, 570, 10771, 311, 36003, 5697, 11, 31651, 332, 1047, 21489, 279, 9240, 3093, 37456, 21918, 311, 387, 279, 1566, 15528, 4953, 408, 2411, 1912, 1603, 279, 5629, 8444, 582, 7246, 320, 17, 303, 12, 18, 6634, 2874, 376, 315, 279, 220, 16, 267, 89785, 21283, 705, 1418, 304, 8903, 420, 3465, 1047, 1027, 2884, 11758, 315, 1667, 6931, 2391, 279, 93356, 5111, 11, 2212, 279, 1890, 1060, 13844, 220, 1049, 15, 320, 45605, 28033, 315, 11162, 220, 1691, 4390, 63717, 315, 1148, 51801, 4510, 3432, 11, 31651, 332, 61021, 291, 3055, 41013, 389, 264, 44797, 1887, 315, 27409, 8219, 4212, 323, 61853, 92028, 21882, 323, 15956, 24059, 3885, 13, 5414, 44797, 1887, 574, 14592, 505, 264, 4459, 3552, 315, 77480, 30126, 24654, 505, 5838, 10612, 13852, 28432, 56097, 220, 18, 11, 24742, 320, 15287, 11, 20749, 18241, 8, 311, 56097, 220, 18, 11, 24742, 11, 10410, 320, 15287, 11, 23642, 18241, 570, 12220, 279, 7558, 12968, 43738, 10474, 315, 279, 3962, 11500, 1697, 31494, 83345, 8194, 10423, 650, 1402, 372, 11, 31651, 332, 11, 889, 1047, 520, 430, 1486, 6244, 362, 540, 347, 71, 61021, 291, 3055, 596, 4443, 7558, 42606, 11, 8040, 505, 19307, 264, 7833, 7394, 11, 7833, 2427, 109956, 1887, 315, 9042, 1652, 10892, 811, 627, 791, 1887, 596, 6913, 16188], "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}]}, {"request_id": "3234", "prompt": "Grace is the mother of John.

Therefore one of the retreats from an horizontal line, connecting Grace to Sarah, has to be located on the upper level, i.e. that of grandmothers. Now we know that there is someone between Grace and Sarah: this person is John. To make it look just right, we make a double-line connection between John and Sarah, because Thomas and Ruby are not specified in the conclusion. Recall, that we need to have at least three nodes in order to have any connections and, in the conclusion's premise, there needs to be one horizontal connection of a person (not specified) with her/his parent. So, some connections are missing, whether to the parents of John or whether to the grandchildren of Grace (or both).\n{recall}Next, we add the remaining facts mentioned in the premise of the argument, filling in specific facts about the nodes missing between John and Sarah and between Grace and Sarah.\n{recall}Now that there are no more missing people or missing connections to other people to be placed. So, one directional edge (single-ray connection) has to be from John to Ruby and from Thomas to Ben, because they both are mothers of the person mentioned as grandchildren of Grace. (Derive reason: this information is not specified in the conclusion, but one of the derivates of Sarah is specified, as stated in the conclusion. So, we have to look at one of the individuals in this relation, namely one child of Sarah.

Little did people know this volcano would erupt again 4 years later. But even after 4 years, people in Ytheris continued to think about making money and building homes. Building the road from Havroth to Eryndor eventually expanded the economic interest of Havroth and so Havroth boomed, creating homes, hotels, and so on. Students going to Erindor all over the country soon found interest to come to Havroth , which created shops, eventually leading to restaurants. Soon smaller cities were being developed around Northern Havroth and inner Havroth. But soon trouble entered Havroth's peace of life.\nAfter the 5th year, a mysterious force began to attack boats at sea. This caused the boat industry at Havroth to start flooding the sea. People began paying money to unavilable boats to damage others plans for earning money. As compensation, boats were soon erased from Havroth entirely. Soon after boats were gone, people began inventing solar-based power, which soon started flooding Havroth. The solar-based power soon caused Havroth to be powered too fast. Soon Havroth stopped moving and just stood still. As a result, Havroth fell apart due to not moving. Little did people know this would happen.

Vaul) has recently been renamed Halls of Silence. If I'd known how many of you there would have been, I would have set-up multiple sessions.\nThey are several reasons for the name change, but mostly because of all the surprise! I thought I told my sister. I had wanted to name the resort Avaloss, but my husband said there already was one city of Avaloss. So I went with this name instead. Originally I planned for Umbrithis (named after the surrounding mountains) to be five countries: Umbrithis, Tractlethia, Analethias, Perynthian Valley, and Almaroth. However, once I found out how many original players there would be, I thought it would be a hassle to find their land, so I made up Tractlethia. So Umbrithis is now the continent, and Tractlethia is split-up between Perynthian Valley and Almaroth. And I know, you're probably thinking, \"Cerdic Puskov, why don't you just get out of your own way? You've making it harder than it needs to be.\" So, here's my reason. If I don't have everything planned beforehand, I don't get anything done. Or rather I get distracted and never finish. So it needs to all be planned beforehand in my sketchpad.

Information in its retail format is data and data in its purest form is an asset. Some believe the value and potential of that information is infinity. Most do not believe that potential to be real but I do. I see the potential in every form of information and believe it should be turned into something useful that can be applied to our daily lives and pushed forward to the future state in which we live by way of data.

It is through our relationships with one another that we are universally able to feed, clothe, shelter and educate each other. The four needs that Mark Packham of Business2C identified are our common denominators, but how do we go about fulfilling them? Learning to value ourselves, our products and services and what we have to offer to help others.

You may see the sky as shining blue in the daytime and a thousand shades of black as the sun sinks beyond the horizon or behind clouds; still it is visible. However, do those colours exist without humans present? In my opinion and the only opinion that counts, the sky is soundless, mute, silent. It emits no colours but projections of its surrounding environment, we just need to see them.

Mia lives in Quellion. Mau lives in Eryndor.\n*Read directions below to find steps to solve this structure (what is known as a hexad) sentence analytically.\nSam came from Quellion many years ago to become part of the family and generally assist in making sure Paul and Maggie were properly attended to. The Adams aren\u2019t too concerned about money, Paul is rich, but both Sam and Paul still work hard. Paul even works outside the hospital where he works. Sam comes from a hunter and gatherer people that were hunted to almost no-extinction. In their logs and documents Paul has found scientific knowledge that has been lost to the ages. Paul studies it and works hard to follow on the principles in those lost documents. He has gathered a comprehensive study and explanations of the logical structure in the ancient documents, giving back much of the greater understanding lost in the ancient times. He generally wraps up old knowledge with logical and unescapable steps. Lets look on this structure.\nThe very simple sentence, \u201cPaul lives in Quellion\u201d, is logically structured analytically into an outline by these simple steps (quadrants). Each step comes from an example. The last 3 quadrants are a continuation of the first 3 quadrants. To see the first 3 quadrants again, go under the magnifying glass on the image to enlarge it. Quadrant 2 and 7 show, right, left, up, down, blue/red, fading, incomplete, complete, change, difference; because as the sentences change from boy to girl, left to right, red to blue, incomplete to completed (fading), child to parent, cousin to uncle, difference to just change.\nThis form of logical structure takes up much less space to write than if I left it to describe it as a fluid sentence. It can also be used to write much smaller amount of information and avoid \u201cconfined knowledge\u201d which is all around us today. This process can be used for all the simple structure texts.

In Bengali, he saw a sign that mentioned three vendors. The sign said \"ART, PICTURES, FURNITURE\" in halfling, but he didn't know very much halfling! He just grazed over it briefly, hoping to come across anything he could read. He found, under the stairs, a human boy in a primer, building a Chien battle on a table. Jack asked about the Chien battle - to the best of his knowledge, Chien were mighty creatures that used to guard over temples - and the human boy explained. While the two talked, Jack peeked over the edge of the primer. It mentioned a few things about halfling baggage, but not much of anything about the Chien. \"Do you know where me might find this primer?\" Jack asked. \"If you want it, it's yours,\" the human boy replied. That seemed strange, so Jack asked a few follow-up questions. \"Why would I give you my primer?\" the boy asked, and Jack realized the primer could not have been worth very much and they were physically on the same level, and - heck. The boy was smiling at him. Jack gleaned what information he could, and walked home with the primer in his hands, knowing that he now know something new about halfling culture. He compared it to the storied creature Others - a kind of lizard-woman - told him a bit about, and knew that it chimed in something she said about baggage.

What\u2019s important to consider in this question is the order of the relationship between Mars, the space station, and the shuttle . To get right, you must first understand the order. Mars\u2014space station\u2014shuttle.\nOrder\u00a0= MOVE faster\nNow\u00a0that everyone has the faster than relationship clear, you can rule out c and d. Next, rule out a because that model is always at rest and never faster or slower than anything else. Therefore, you are left with b, Mars being 50 mph faster than the space station and losing the shuttle.\nRemember, you are looking for the distance between two points. Realize that in this problem you are looking for the distance from the rocket\u2019s nose container straight down to the spaceship itself. Of course, since the container extends at the (no) end of this fall, you must travel the distance to the container (which is attached to the nose) and then the distance down the chute to the canyon floor. You have to travel twice as fast to cover that distance.

Torrek Larthane will reform one special militia force and present the details to Eliana. Rotation from Ophirion to Halver places the fleet operating outside of Earth.

(A Logical Fallacy is a pattern of argumentation that erroneously leads to a conclusion. Our demonstration of this fallacy is our attempt to show that people far away from us speak as we speak!)\nlogical fallacy, anecdotal argumentation, and the lesion analogy\nThe anecdotal argument\nWe all respect learning by doing. Life is practical. Everyone knows that trial by fire is effective. So, it seems absolutely sensible to say that what an individual has done flawlessly without a mistake over several years, does not require further references of external authorities. This is called \u201clearning by doing.\u201d\nTo demonstrate why the anecdotal argument can fail, assume that someone reports to be eating natural foods, exercising every day for more than two hours, avoiding air pollutants, staying calm during nights, and treating the disabled. How do you check if this person\u2019s description is accurate? Can you simply verify it by a quick glance? No way! Let\u2019s imagine having a friend who serves excellent meals, sleeps at noon and is standing even during night parties. Would you still eat a bite of food at this friend\u2019s home? No. You know that consuming a single meal at this place will unhealthily thicken your body fat for several days. Similarly, an islander\u2019s light appearance does not mean that her diet or exercise is the right fit for everyone. Indeed, her appearance may result from the presence of heavy pesticides in the soil. I do not know which scenario is the true story. However, all of these situations suggest the idea that there is no universal and practical way of being fair to an individual, unless we have gained all relevant information.\nThe Lesion Analogy\nTo further explain the misleading nature of the anecdotal argument, consider a hypothetical analogy. A woman is currently at a time point \u201ct\u201d. You can show that her hands are broken. She admits there are some differences, in comparison to her past hand\u2019s condition. However, she agrees that her past hands (in terms of condition) were not perfect either. She also says that she did not smash her fingers using water jets.

If the above tells you a lot, then you should fill in your result below. If not, then do read the story below for more background.\nIn the land of Eternam, most countries are islands. People live for about a century and after that, they go to a different dimension.\nThey die by the age of 110 so that new people can live. Isaac, Sophia, Julia, Mark, Lucy and Anna can only speak their own language. They are so used to speaking their own language that they forget how to speak other languages. They also need to invent the equivalent words for when they talk in other languages.\nZorvath was settled three hundred years ago. It is part of the empire of Ytheris- the largest in the empire. The royal family speaks Japanese though nearly all of the people speak German. So before people try to learn their language, they will be forced to learn German. People trying to sneak will remain there forever.\nLuminax is a small farming town. Referred to as the mall, this is a must see tourist spot, just like Paris which is popular across the border in Solmyra. People living here speak Italian. They are welcoming and friendly.\nIsaac finally just had enough. His friends nearly made him gurgling with love because they kept talking about kisses. As the youngest, they had been picking on him since before his 6th century birthday. Alright, so Isaac had made a mistake, he liked them.\nAnyway, Isaac devised a plan to go to his grandma\u2019s house, so that he could have all his family to himself. He got all of them to say they were not his best friends anymore. He had a tough time convincing Lucy and Julia this way. Also, when Isaac told his dogs \u201cZider\u201d and \u201cRose\u201d that this was his new plan, they hid under the bed.\nThey did allow him in their little clubhouse though, and he told them this is his new plan. On his birthday, he was going to cross the bridge to get to the other side.\nSo that is what he did. He packed a big lunch and sang songs. He was so excited", "token_ids": [43288, 13, 1442, 279, 3485, 10975, 499, 264, 2763, 11, 1243, 499, 1288, 5266, 304, 701, 1121, 3770, 13, 1442, 539, 11, 1243, 656, 1373, 279, 3446, 3770, 369, 810, 4092, 627, 644, 279, 4363, 315, 469, 4253, 309, 11, 1455, 5961, 527, 30100, 13, 9029, 3974, 369, 922, 264, 9478, 323, 1306, 430, 11, 814, 733, 311, 264, 2204, 13167, 627, 7009, 2815, 555, 279, 4325, 315, 220, 5120, 779, 430, 502, 1274, 649, 3974, 13, 42608, 11, 71471, 11, 40394, 11, 4488, 11, 45170, 323, 24101, 649, 1193, 6604, 872, 1866, 4221, 13, 2435, 527, 779, 1511, 311, 12365, 872, 1866, 4221, 430, 814, 10894, 1268, 311, 6604, 1023, 15823, 13, 2435, 1101, 1205, 311, 17459, 279, 13890, 4339, 369, 994, 814, 3137, 304, 1023, 15823, 627, 57, 269, 85, 589, 574, 23183, 2380, 7895, 1667, 4227, 13, 1102, 374, 961, 315, 279, 32447, 315, 816, 700, 285, 12, 279, 7928, 304, 279, 32447, 13, 578, 30336, 3070, 21881, 11002, 3582, 7154, 682, 315, 279, 1274, 6604, 6063, 13, 2100, 1603, 1274, 1456, 311, 4048, 872, 4221, 11, 814, 690, 387, 9770, 311, 4048, 6063, 13, 9029, 4560, 311, 45264, 690, 7293, 1070, 16058, 627, 43, 10318, 710, 374, 264, 2678, 33489, 6424, 13, 1050, 5671, 311, 439, 279, 34353, 11, 420, 374, 264, 2011, 1518, 31070, 7858, 11, 1120, 1093, 12366, 902, 374, 5526, 4028, 279, 3973, 304, 11730, 2465, 969, 13, 9029, 5496, 1618, 6604, 15155, 13, 2435, 527, 36387, 323, 11919, 627, 3957, 65805, 5616, 1120, 1047, 3403, 13, 5414, 4885, 7154, 1903, 1461, 342, 5673, 2785, 449, 3021, 1606, 814, 8774, 7556, 922, 73091, 13, 1666, 279, 39637, 11, 814, 1047, 1027, 21816, 389, 1461, 2533, 1603, 813, 220, 21, 339, 9478, 15553, 13, 98693, 11, 779, 42608, 1047, 1903, 264, 16930, 11, 568, 15262, 1124, 627, 49388, 11, 42608, 69120, 264, 3197, 311, 733, 311, 813, 83777, 753, 3838, 11, 779, 430, 568, 1436, 617, 682, 813, 3070, 311, 5678, 13, 1283, 2751, 682, 315, 1124, 311, 2019, 814, 1051, 539, 813, 1888, 4885, 14926, 13, 1283, 1047, 264, 11292, 892, 40661, 45170, 323, 40394, 420, 1648, 13, 7429, 11, 994, 42608, 3309, 813, 12875, 1054, 57, 1814, 863, 323, 1054, 58524, 863, 430, 420, 574, 813, 502, 3197, 11, 814, 31894, 1234, 279, 4950, 627, 7009, 1550, 2187, 1461, 304, 872, 2697, 94533, 3582, 11, 323, 568, 3309, 1124, 420, 374, 813, 502, 3197, 13, 1952, 813, 15553, 11, 568, 574, 2133, 311, 5425, 279, 14497, 311, 636, 311, 279, 1023, 3185, 627, 4516, 430, 374, 1148, 568, 1550, 13, 1283, 19937, 264, 2466, 16163, 323, 29340, 11936, 13, 1283, 574, 779, 12304], "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}]}, {"request_id": "3325", "prompt": "Emma is the mother of John.

Max is the mother of Luke's son Joe. Jack and Mark are the sons of Sarah.\nIt is to be noted that since Tom is the son of John, hence John is the mother of Tom. But John is not the grandmother of Max, Jack and Mark as the relations of John, mother, son and grandson do not apply in their case. It is to be noted that grandmother denotes the relationship of mother to her grandchild. Then the father and the mother of Joe are also the father and mother of Alice respectively. Therefore, the relationship of Joe and mother of Alice should be established by ensuring that grandmother is still the relationship of mother to her grandchild even in the third generation.\nSince the relationship of grandmother of John to his daughter in law i.e. relationship of mother to Sarah, a daughter in law is that of grandmother and that of Joe to his wife, a daughter in law is that of Alice, a mother. Then by use of lateral relationship we can establish the relationship of father of Alice to son in law of Sarah and that of son in law of Sarah to Joe as son in law. Hence the family relations can be expressed in the given diagram as depicted in Figure as follows:\nIn Figure I can clearly be seen that the grandmother is the mother and not a grand mother to and that Sarah is the mother in law and wife of Paul and Joe respectively. If in Figure, I is replaced by A, R has to be Sarah and B, N and C, L are Joseph, Paul and Max respectively. Contextually, A and C are Joseph and Paul.\nTherefore by further counting it can be seen that since C is the father of Jack therefore, father of A should also be the father of B.

To find example localities that would make similar answers more definitively true, find an island roughly the same geographic shape as North Ameria and locate cities on its coast with the same and opposite latitudes to North American cities. The island should be big enough that (by coincidence) there is a city at 37 degrees north and 37 degrees south. Glacidae is probably located near the polar or ice cap region, and Havroth is, therefore, located near the warmer region that is common to the continents of Eberth and Aries. The climate for Havroth is far more stratiform (one can live year-round outside even with only moderately warm clothing). In contrast, Glacidae is characterized more by labyrinthine regions; much time is passed indoors away from the cold weather. Havroth occurs in a regions that has savannahs, mesas, mountains, tropical rainforests, forests, alpine meadows, and deserts. Tyseria is typified by flat plains and savannahs. This means that the province of Ophirion is narrow and long. Glacidae has more distinct seasons; the revitalization of its economy has come about through leveraging its snow season as a tourist attraction. Noctari is located in an area that has a year-round, temperate climate. Its economy is heavily weighted toward fleet services.\nYears of life are measured differently from country to country, and even the year of life is a somewhat arbitrary measurement. It seems like Glacidae was the only city that came up with an institutionalized measurement of life years. It keeps track of life years from conception. No such invention is required of the system of Luminax (the country of Noctari), due to its high average life expectancy, which is about 140. The period of conscious life is not accounted for.

The reason for this is that G.Kid did it first and the synchronization runs smoothly when two parts talk to each other. Also, I approve of the method. Why? Because the Times I will be monitoring are:\nBefore 23:00 London = Before 8:00 in America (NOTE) You say you want to be awake with the fumi'.\nBelow 23:00 London = Below 12:00 Fumi' in America\n24:00 London = 12:00 afternoon. (NOTE) One hour gets messed up.\nBelow 24:00 London = Below 12:00 Fumi' in America\nAny changes made to these settings will be given to the opposite timezone if both parties agree. This more than likely is due to fortune cookie. Do not mind if it is incorrect, for now! Too complicated :s\nHandled on the forum. Pretty self explanatory; we just hold IRC channels or change the time. The time line is from 24:00 London = 17:00 Amerika.

(In regions of more than one language per person, one must determine which languages are spoken only in that region and can remove those languages from consideration.)\n\u2022 Borders between two countries should obey the described method only in case those country-borders are not larger than a single language area\nGenerally, a language spoken in multiple countries is , but no single language can be spoken by even two people in two different countries, not with a historically verifiable language area in one of those countries.\nThis puzzle has some very nice examples where cities are following (and disobeying) the rules, and some interesting twists as well.\nCool puzzle!

I have no problem with that requirement being built into the puzzle, but I do wonder if that overstates the relationship between official and local dialects.\nI think it\u2019s often unhelp", "token_ids": [24113, 13, 4488, 21881, 31209, 13, 32171, 21881, 37366, 13, 25459, 21881, 8690, 627, 8607, 4279, 5718, 3881, 994, 23524, 4221, 4398, 512, 6806, 56064, 430, 527, 24894, 311, 832, 2500, 527, 3060, 43379, 82, 315, 279, 1890, 2748, 4221, 477, 527, 37555, 385, 713, 4351, 750, 5552, 11, 602, 1770, 13, 814, 617, 264, 4279, 6371, 627, 6806, 1442, 264, 3363, 12365, 1630, 4221, 374, 1828, 311, 264, 3363, 12365, 816, 4221, 11, 362, 690, 6604, 816, 323, 426, 690, 6604, 1630, 627, 6806, 2057, 3504, 682, 15823, 22066, 304, 459, 4553, 5654, 11, 832, 5829, 832, 4221, 824, 1732, 13, 320, 644, 13918, 315, 810, 1109, 832, 4221, 824, 1732, 11, 832, 2011, 8417, 902, 15823, 527, 22066, 1193, 304, 430, 5654, 323, 649, 4148, 1884, 15823, 505, 18361, 29275, 6806, 81812, 1990, 1403, 5961, 1288, 41701, 279, 7633, 1749, 1193, 304, 1162, 1884, 3224, 1481, 8076, 527, 539, 8294, 1109, 264, 3254, 4221, 3158, 198, 77641, 11, 264, 4221, 22066, 304, 5361, 5961, 374, 1174, 719, 912, 3254, 4221, 649, 387, 22066, 555, 1524, 1403, 1274, 304, 1403, 2204, 5961, 11, 539, 449, 264, 35901, 2807, 23444, 4221, 3158, 304, 832, 315, 1884, 5961, 627, 2028, 25649, 706, 1063, 1633, 6555, 10507, 1405, 9919, 527, 2768, 320, 438, 68735, 1216, 287, 8, 279, 5718, 11, 323, 1063, 7185, 62990, 439, 1664, 627, 57850, 25649, 0, 362, 10284, 16682, 4623, 315, 3451, 11789, 12135, 20182, 719, 433, 4375, 1633, 1664, 198, 2688, 5115, 2771, 922, 293, 16, 323, 293, 17, 13, 1442, 2999, 300, 374, 389, 33084, 11, 323, 2999, 300, 323, 1901, 269, 85, 589, 527, 2167, 36956, 11, 3250, 1431, 430, 2873, 311, 34608, 430, 814, 2011, 6604, 264, 4279, 4221, 30, 5112, 25459, 323, 7043, 1053, 2225, 617, 311, 6604, 8690, 627, 5159, 25649, 2795, 597, 17, 1288, 387, 43876, 11, 719, 358, 1193, 14000, 430, 439, 459, 97249, 1990, 14132, 71240, 2038, 627, 40, 1541, 1431, 1781, 430, 279, 4623, 315, 682, 15823, 304, 459, 3158, 320, 72, 1770, 2637, 279, 43379, 82, 433, 5727, 11, 477, 520, 3325, 264, 3254, 43379, 439, 3450, 83, 425, 42926, 3585, 704, 705, 1524, 422, 814, 3207, 19180, 555, 5426, 24743, 11, 12365, 279, 1890, 2385, 4221, 11, 374, 13750, 40880, 279, 90030, 323, 23965, 315, 22066, 15823, 304, 459, 3158, 627, 13699, 11, 279, 5718, 1541, 1431, 11810, 459, 3927, 311, 539, 6604, 279, 4033, 4221, 315, 872, 3224, 13, 358, 617, 912, 3575, 449, 430, 16686, 1694, 5918, 1139, 279, 25649, 11, 719, 358, 656, 5895, 422, 430, 927, 33169, 279, 5133, 1990, 4033, 323, 2254, 43379, 82, 627, 40, 1781, 433, 753, 3629, 653, 8823], "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}]}, {"request_id": "3376", "prompt": "Kryostis is a species in the genus Fluxilus.

Moreover, Lucy and Ben do speak the same language they do. OR Lucy and Ben do NOT speak the same language they do.\u00a0Therefore, either: On the one hand, we know that the first assertion (i.e. that they do speak the same language), or, on the other hand, we know that the second assertion (i.e. that they do not speak the same language). Therefore, we do NOT need to introduce any additional assertions (save the 'Therefore' assertions) with Kripke style plural reference to keep the relevant triad from breaking.\u00a0 The point is that, in general, to say something is to say something that isn't. It seems to me, though, that if there is a job of model theory to be done it should be to provide a mathematically useful mapping here. That is, if we ask \"What, if anything, does the assertion about Kate, Joe, Ben, and Lucy imply about whether, say, Kate and Ben really speak the same language?\", we know, I think, that Kripke style rules of pluralized reference will be able to give us a reasonably understandable answer. The most important advantage of abandoning the standard order of reference is not that it enables us to form more useful notions syntactically.

It is fairly common for young students to think that their nation is the primary world, as there is such little information on the other countries and continents.\nDespite there not being much information available, Cyphrites are taught the names of most of the countries and continents and their comparable size. This can be seen in the country chart below. The following chart assumes that you have ample information on how Cyphrites calculate it's most basic dimensions. More specific information on these subjects will be listed here later.\nMost visibly, Balthorien and Zorvath are equal to Noctari across their widest parts, and are smaller to Noctari along their lengths. Zorvath's breadths (the areas known as mythoria) are smaller than those of Balthorien. Balthorien also has a greater length than Zorvath.\nZorvath contains Ealdominion while Balthorien contains Ulththorium and Ald'Hara. While Ealdominion is as large as Ulththorium, Ealdominion's length is much shorter, while Ulththorium's breadth is virtually the same as Ealdominion's at its widest.\nIt is common awareness amongst Cyphrites that the country of Ald'Hara is much larger than Vynora. This is due to the fact that Ald'Hara contains both the countries of Luminax and Sentenna. Vynora is also much smaller than the surrounding continent. It is assumed that Vynora is simply a separate country on the continent of Umbrithis.

Solmyra is six hours ahead of Luminax. Each city, aside from Luminax, is three hours ahead of their neighbor.\nLuminax is making the final preparations for the midnight drop as I ready myself for the sky. I close my eyes to envision the jump. My heart quickens as does a hot excitement flow through my veins. I imagine the airborne sensation as the breeze rolls through my hair. Emotionally, those moments feel more real than the certainty of holding my newest flicker blades. I cannot wait to feel the pull of jumpglock connectors as they slowly, then more quickly, wind. I think of everything the black cloaks grabbed from us on the arctic raid, the one civilian's death and his smoked shape left behind. Agents with sometimes a marked look of content roll proudly along to the Ayrness as we leap into the air.\nI shake off what little dawdling is left within me. I recognize a familiar sense of magic brew building up inside my body, and I am only excited to find it. The rapid but seamless emergence of lids on flicker blades is enhanced by the quick click of power/operating buttons. In my hands, the three-kilogram weapons dig in to my palms and my body is buoyed high off the ground and into the air by the seemingly paranormal increase of air density near me. I feel my chest inflate snuggly to the moment. This sensation is more than a physical pull, but a deep float in the air. The air feels a perfect, unavoidable marriage towards my jump lockers. Then comes the merging hooks with connectors. Both hands are lifted to properly secure the insecure helm sockets into my gleaming vest.\nI'm united. I'm in sync. The launch begins and in advance of special representation processes, a real time instinct has revealed itself. Flicker blade power has so much accuracy that it cannot be interchanged by any sort of true time flicker. This is the kind of flicker technology Raptors use to get accurate traverses.

I don\u2019t remember the exact debate but know I know that he was arguing with a guy who opposed any evidence for real existence of Ancient Sanskrit texts such as Vedas. The debate became more intellectual and later, I don\u2019t know what happened, but Gaurav\u2019s opponent wanted proof that ancient Sanskrit texts Vedic scriptures are actually evidence for existence of an advanced ancient civilization prevalent before 500 B.C. The debate became more and more agitated, but somehow, because he was dealing with fact filled writing, under the weight of his accent he had a sense of being on the defensive and lost the debate miserably.\nOnce Indian friend of mine, Gaurav, shared with me a debate he had with a follower of Sam Harris. Inspired from Sam Harris\u2019 book \u2018The End of Faith\u2019 the guy was trying to convince Gaurav that knowledge derived from blogosphere and internet do much more good than torturing someone for knowing the whereabouts of Osama Bin Laden (of the gone down good byes). His claim was much like those arguing against freedom of speech. I disliked his description of \u201cpeople tortured without trial\u201d versus \u201cpeople who reaped the benefits of science\u201d debate. It becomes evident to Sam\u2019s follower that all knowledge science produces this day has come from ruthless destruction of lab animals along with experiments and torture on defenseless human beings.

And in the last three hours the barkeeper has a second port city, keeping it all in a row. No wonder he seems to have such fun. Think of a clock-face and on every hour there is a port in one of the 12 places of Vynora.\nThe time of the veins in Ophirion and Vynora are one hour different. Although Vynora is appreciated and loved in Ophirion, not everybody follows the same time. In Ophirion, the clock reads one hour earlier than in Vynora.\nOn the road from Ophirion to Vynora the timing often shifts.\nI invited a Grimmag priestess to help her fosterling. She put her knife in my left hand, blood, her tears and obsession, the knife in my right hand, heart, my blessing, and called in Griffin. He bowed to me, and knelt before the priestess.\nVynora is blessed. The crowd sways and I can only breathe in their prayers, but not see their faces. I inhale wild days, riddled nights, gratitude. Always gratitude. The blond woman hundreds back, in the middle of the crowd, she nods at me, her mouth opens like a flower, as if to tell me thank you. Thank you, I say to her?\nWe Ophiri call them the Veins of Ophirion. The streams of veins and blood within the rest of their Vaelor territories.

Lucy is Kate's aunt. Anna and Grace are Lucy and Kate's twins. John's twin, called Paul, is the father of Amy. Mike is the father of 3 of Paul and John's children and Joe is the grandfather of Grace, which makes him the grandfather of Lucy, Kate, Anna and Sarah. So, John is Sarah's grandfather, as it says in Inferential.\nall related [correct spell in f-inferential], obviously in the case of John.\nSo John is related with Sarah through the link of Paul(John's brother)and also with Grace (real aunt of Lucy and Kate).\nCan I choose one branch and reject (or eliminate) the other? Who is the aunt of both Anna and Kate?\nI don't think we can choose one over the other, since all \"aunts\" are brides at the same time. But here is my view.\nWhen I say John is the grandfather of Anna, I mean John's A-level twin Paul is the father of Jonathan who has a son Tom: Tom is the only thing linking John at A-level to Anna. Simply speaking, boys who inherit genes from the same father are called A-level twins: they share the same paternal genetic materials. In contrast, boys who inherit genes from the same mother are called B-level twins: they share the same maternal genetic materials. I guess A-level twins yet have common chromosomes and mitochondrial DNA (as common originals) but B-level twins also have common genes with each other. Note that there is only one kind of such maternal giving mother for A-level and B-level females. For B-level and especially A-level males, there are two kinds: identical and Pseudo-identical. Identical males are rare and Pseudo-identical males don't only share genes from their paternal wive but also from their own mother (I think they inherit genes from the same maternal grandmother, so they can be stronger related).

So, the person who finishes writing his letter last must have started after exactly 42 minutes. There are two ways to answer it. Technically the ans must be Fern because she delivered the letter to Kath.\nOne other way to solve this is that Fern must be the last person to deliver a letter because irrespective it had started at 42 mins Min. Fern started writing at 1 h. 42mins. Di started writing at 1 h. 48mins :30sec = at 1 h. 49 mins [Tech error] + 2 mins.

Maybe you can consider some problems for time after 2.45 also because the watch will show 1.45 at 2.46 after an advance of 60 seconds (from 11.45 to 12.45 onwards just watch gives the advance of 60 seconds). However, the study might argue that mathematically the watch should show 12:45 at 2.45.\nThe speed of Peter\u2019s car, Jimmy\u2019s car and Polly\u2019s car are a:s:b =3:2:1 since the last part of the journey is 3:2:1. So, a:s = 6:4 =fast, since the whole journey, a,b,c have been covered in the same time. Now, the speed a3 = b12 = c123 so a:b:c =b2:15:c12 implies b:a = 5:3 implies b3 = a5 = c35.\nThe slowest car is the one with the greater ratio of the later parts of the journey.

The term Glacidae is used to classify species of the genus Gryvus. They do not live in groups of more than twelve. Neither do they attack in gangs. They are loners that hunt in packs in the heat of battle. Glacidae are between 706 and 700 centimeters tall, they are the most intelligent non-sapient member of the Zyphericus. Like their carnivorous cousins, they do not like to live long within a congenial environment. They live in the northern perimeter of the Macroverse.\nGlacidae, are green and white in color. They have evolved from the Nullsuitian era. Most Glacidae are one to two centimeters tall.\nThey are not instinctive beings like Naglae and other fradled subtracts.

Nodes may only be connected by their cheapest trade routes to a maximum of 2 other directly connected countries, otherwise they will be inefficiently occupied. Therefore the rivers are best drawn as two country-wide bridges between Tyseria and Sebyss and between Havroth and Fendrel. This is due to restrictions on archeology on the river banks which do not impede trade across rivers in other places.\n3. 1 Nodes belong exclusively to one country with upstream boundaries defined by specific river.

So, the conclusion will be INVALID, only when either Max is a grandfather to Grace or Amy is a grandmother to Grace. This is not possible as Anna is the only kid of Max. So, in case she gives birth to Grace, she will become the grandmother. Suppose, Mark or Amy gives birth to Grace, then we have to add another generation of grandfather-to-grandchild-relationship, which in either way will not be valid and Max will not become the grandfather.CORRECT ANSWER.\nHello Expert !

When the Light Courts entered the Void, they created a set of rules for the governing of nations so that they would not have to add their own rules every time a new civilization grew up. The High Ages are those ruled by the Light Courts, and the Low Ages are those ruled by people. The High Ages of Andromeda are 440.\nHigh Ages History Edit\nThe current High Ages were formerly ruled by one of the Light Courts, and what they decided, you did. However, after Legion, when the Courts abandoned the worlds, the people of the world were free to make their own decisions again, and so they formed High Councils wherein they have decide their many worlds' fates. In addition, because the people were living in one giant area again, they've somewhat managed to form the Low Council, under the High Council, to deal with Low Ages affairs. Currently, only one third of the people (Three out of 9 nations) can have their actual High Council, or the Light Courts, come back.\nThe High Ages are comprised of nine worlds, but each ages' governing body is limited to one world, so to remove yourself from oversight, governments may regularly move themselves to another time zone, therefore distancing themselves from actual oversight.

Not only did I find part of the realm of Zenumak that I was looking for, I found a bit of treasure in the process. I found the old refineriium on the eastern side of the realm and its contents intact. After walking through Lanfort and Vandarg the entire night, I felt tired enough to go to sleep if I had not found it. Fortunately, I found it and was able to gather the gold and gems it contained. I have more spiritual stones than I thought. It will take me a bit of time to find the portal that I need so that I may return to my home world and escape from here.\nAs I am walking along the way, I run into a couple ants and go to attack them. They are killed instantly by my attack but are detected by a nearby Gnoll. Literally moments later, there is this raiding party headed my way. I have more armor than the first time that I was attacked so some of cold does not harm me quite as much as it would have. I even had the half shield icon this time. I also had a mana shield. I felt safer this time around and was more comfortable using the ultimate attack and my overdrive. I used both of them quite a bit as the raiding horde consisted of about 15 Gnolls and 1 Ghast. I was wondering what the odds were of getting surrounded by the Ghast. It's not the first time that I have been surrounded however. It was dangerous yet fun. This battle was more of a hell for them than I. There was definitely a whole lore or two worth of experience in this fight. I know for a fact that the Ghast took it hard because his friends severe limbs from each other. I don't think that he was going to play around with that.

In any circumstance however, I highly doubt that Zorvath's already dire situation was compounded by the introduction of plants and trees. Whilst green lies the land, I will share with you the tale of Zorvath by presentation of its fate: story.pdf\nChristell Reei: I recall hearing rumors of a landhold from my childhood, but I cannot remember the name. The closest I can guess would be something like Zorvath.\nNeylyge: We are Kryoian and Zorvathian exiles, seeking asylum from mad monarchs. We were born and spent all of our lives on the island of Langor, before Zorvathian forces invaded the island hunting down innocent men, women and children. We live a simple life. I delle fish, wine, bread, and the meats we have salvaged from wreckage. I began to develop a better crop of vegetables, slowly increase our food stores and stockpile a better selection of meat. I also dabble in magic to cure sickness and infirmities, and I would love to gain a better understanding of totemism and alchemy and brewing. Prukadri has journeyed further afield to collect a greater supply of meats for us, when possible. Eventually we would like a totem hall to protect our harvests from the predators who seek to drive us out of our place of safety. If they are dead, they can't eat us, can they? But first (and right now) we need shelter from the elements, food, and water.\nRomeo : This is Zorvath. Desolate land. It once was chocked full of life, with lush forests and clear rivers.

Kryostis, Thalorium, Xyphodon, and Zyphodon form a species group. Some marine species undergo deep-water migration.\nIt is not uncommon for marine invertebrates to migrate into deep waters during daytime, even if fish within all marine waters are quite rare during the day. When many of the surface waters have significant phytoplankton production, and nighttime conditions are favorable for this production, a series of marine conveyor belt movements occur in these waters.\nThe origin of these migrations is not yet completely understood, but some studies have shown a link between the movement of the boundary of the sun\u2019s light to the direction of these migrations. Some of the newer radiocarbon dating methods have been applied to marine species to show the changes in various surface gradients. Snow and Ice Drift Patterns This migration of marine life during the day is probably an exchange of slads of icebreakers carrying water along with fish, mollusks and other migratory species.\nThis exchange is one of the most exciting discoveries for geochemical research. At the heart of the exchange is a series of ice drifts that accumulate and melt in the sea bottom during the ice melting process. These ice-drifts often carry with them the remains of marine life. These remains are preserved beneath the accumulated ice and salt, and it is sometimes easier to tell from these drifts of ice more about marine migration patterns than from a whole array of samples, let alone from Ice Drift and seasonal Ice phenomena.\nAll species that live in saltwater have nutrition and living environments that support them in many ways. Though these conditions are favorable, they also change a lot during the year, and the changes are often gradual. For example, in the first spring and summer months the seas are covered with stratified ice, drifting ice, and the floating ice sheets. Then, during the autumn and winter months, the ice that has fallen in the sea does not melt, but instead flows with great vigor toward the north pole.\nThe North pole moves around a lot\u2014sometimes going directly north into the center of Greenland and back again, while sometimes crossing ice fields and being rerouted.

You would still use the country's language in articles internally (especially in the plots themselves). Also, whenever a character is introduced, you should mention whether they speak the language or not ; you can always say that they can speak it enough to understand it enough to understand the character well enough to write their backstory without too much trouble. Say this in proper RP, not wiki speak. For example, Mark speaks only enough Hebrew to know some swear words. German is like English, but German has changed even more than English. Although Ruby can speak English, her grammar is terrifying.\nAssuming you want to spread your fictional language to real life, it is not possible (Except for Welsh, Gaelic and Irish scrip languages).

Eldrinth is in Yvorith, indirectly within Urtha, and Gorth is in Yvorith, who is a species in the genus Eldrinth. Urtha holds the families Yvorith and Eldrinth. Luckily, Urtha is in Phlegdut.

It is purely based on logic and involve some twists and turns to get the answer. Now, check below to see if it is easier to get the answer.\nMother of Mark is Alex\nMark is the mother of Tom (i.e. Alex is the grandfather of Tom)\nTom is the mother of Luke (i.e. Alex is grandfather of Luke)\nLuke is the mother of Amy (i.e. Alex is the grandfather of Amy)\nAmy is the Father of Sam (i.e. Alex is the grandmother of Sam)\nSam is the mother of Alice (Alex is the Great grandmother of Alice)\nFrom question 3 -> 9 -> 11, we have Kate is Alex\u2019s little grandchild\nFrom question 14 -> 5 -> 4, we have Kate is Alex\u2019s great grandchild\nTherefore conclusion is that Alex is great-grandmother of Sam\u2019s daughter Alice and Kate. However if two mother-daughter pairs exist, they can be either of 2 pairs:\n  1. one and only one of Mark. Tom. Luke. Amy or Kate\n  1. Tom is the mother of Kate (i.e. Alex is the grandfather of Kate)\u00a0* as 5)\n  2. Luke is the mother of Tom (i.e. Alex is the great grandfather of Tom)\n  3.

Tom is the mother of Kate (i.e. Alex is the grandfather of Kate)\n  6. Ben is the mother of Tom (i.e. Alex is the grandson of Tom)\nThus Tom is link to Alex from question 2. Thus x=Tom. Kate is child\u2019s relation to Tom. The first four statements is satisfied as as Alice and Kate are two child\u2019s relationship to Tom.

Labeling could also restrict the number of possible transcription start sites such that the nucleotide immediately downstream would be lost in the labeling process. In addition, because only one signal (or tag) is associated with each transcript, it is possible to use the signal(s) to create a collection of transcripts that share a specific domain sequence.

Obviously, Anna is definitely Max\u2019s daughter. So, on Thursday, Max should be a father and Max\u2019s wife was definitely Adam\u2019s mother. We do not know how many people should be Anna\u2019s spouse. Anna can be either Grace wife\u2019s daughter or Abraham wife\u2019s daughter or both. If Anna is Grace wife\u2019s daughter, then John is definitely Max\u2019s son. If Anna is not Grace wife\u2019s daughter, then Anna will be Amy\u2019s brother. Since we do not know Anna\u2019s gender, we can not decide which one is the case. It is important to note that if we could have many products for Max, we can follow different paths for the husband of Anna with different order. However, Anna is girl. So, Max\u2019s only choice for husband is his wife. It permanently makes Max\u2019s only child on Tuesday (between Joe and Jack) is Jack. There is no way to change husband with these assumptions.

Evolutionary models were constructed in the 1960\u2019s (Evans, 1966, Poirier, 1971) which provide a progressive proof system for automated reasoning in cases where it is not possible to work out the solution through the real world. Erik Demaine and crew have taken these in turn into the realm of computer programming with the Graph Grammars for automatic \u201cbranch and logic\u201d when passing from student clauses to professional observations (which are the critical and obvious triggers of the main function in a more general framework, in which these usually tend to be anticipated triggers: i.e. \u201cfalls into\u201d, \u201cunderstands\u201d, \u201coften\u201d etc.).\nA general software system for visual proof search, which can then be used for automatic downloading of relevant files from an analytics group, is currently NNEED (NNEED is a Z base system for local branch and program searching, developed from NNEED and NNEED++ by Faux, Huftyk, and Benetsky, based on software provided by the authors to Regnecentralen, West Mongolia, in collaboration with visiting tutors from Xerte Co (https://www.regnecentralen.nl/languagesheller/reference/).\nIt also works back from database triggers. So, if we want to pass some intuitive daily action, why not go to the real world?

Precisely, it requires three dimensions: World (this world, a parallel world, another, etc.), FullContinents (\u201cTerra\u201d, \u201cORBIS\u201d, \u201cSaturn\u201c, \u201cPluto\u201c), BundledLands (shows only the countries on Terra, but you can find the countries in some BundledLands: Fendrel, Umbrithis, Noctari, Luminax). In some sense, it can be said that CentralSyllabi is a translation machine that removes global politics within each country, each state, each city. First way to travel, using the acquaintance of the person: Where is X located? Towards what direction? How many kilometers between A and B? The second way to travel: using diverse suggestive information.\nExplore in CentralSyllabi your links.

Therefore, an expert drinking apple juice in Paradise Harbour is drinking what we would call \u201chealthy\u201d apple juice. In addition, to live in Ophirion is to drink healthy juice.\nCho lives in Glacidae and Cho only drinks juice that originates from Ophirion. Emma has been to Glacidae and Emma is Cho\u2019s best friend. Therefore, Emma has drunk from a juice cup which originated in Ophirion. However, Emma has never seen any signs that are not healthy. Therefore, every bottle of juice in Glacidae is a healthy apple juice bottle. However, according to the researchers who are not specialized in acedemia, certain kinds of apple juice are not healthy for us. Therefore, these healthy apple juices are healthy for everybody.\n(justification in italics):\nNarrator: Borland [is] a teddy bear. Hulk Hogan is there to take care of this bear.

During his morning shower, he realizes that his mind does not want to accept the fact that he is alive. Although he realizes that he should go on living, he feels death is imminent, because it would free him from suffering. This feeling persists until he decides to meditate inside his bathroom. This happens every morning. The effect on his day is the same.

Maybe a childish dream.\nQuote from: Arinar", "token_ids": [445, 10318, 710, 323, 6573, 3115, 26467, 527, 1630, 88, 764, 77152, 323, 11730, 2465, 969, 13, 56208, 299, 339, 323, 816, 700, 285, 617, 1027, 23838, 627, 5966, 8505, 25, 6841, 220, 972, 11, 220, 679, 16, 11, 220, 605, 25, 1721, 25, 1721, 6912, 555, 35238, 47, 81875, 198, 41251, 13528, 1662, 713, 437, 198, 4812, 25, 22153, 63650, 323, 35305, 1068, 59845, 198, 18990, 60, 2276, 315, 369, 3427, 26467, 198, 4137, 25, 6785, 16537, 198, 53042, 25, 30631, 3913, 788, 20783, 198, 20956, 6241, 25, 5348, 30631, 3913, 788, 7365, 198, 791, 220, 17, 67, 21, 374, 304, 17710, 3645, 11, 779, 387, 2771, 311, 617, 17710, 9147, 304, 2015, 311, 1518, 279, 2472, 627, 17, 35, 21, 54837, 320, 2028, 374, 279, 9191, 2472, 11, 719, 433, 2216, 5039, 264, 1695, 13340, 315, 1475, 3967, 220, 17, 35, 21, 3224, 340, 17, 67, 21, 7054, 5814, 320, 2170, 3970, 304, 865, 74, 4484, 674, 19146, 1763, 26840, 1005, 9054, 3630, 37828, 4999, 40, 1053, 1093, 311, 617, 57338, 810, 36684, 20103, 22067, 11, 649, 499, 923, 264, 2478, 10687, 311, 36684, 20103, 2712, 68, 67245, 24165, 198, 13699, 11, 264, 2478, 315, 15316, 304, 622, 33207, 1771, 1053, 387, 1695, 627, 41251, 13528, 1662, 713, 437, 627, 40, 8434, 956, 4059, 520, 682, 422, 10641, 24155, 3287, 956, 636, 40477, 304, 1077, 6212, 198, 20031, 505, 25, 6342, 7002, 8115, 355, 389, 6790, 220, 1591, 11, 220, 679, 16, 11, 220, 2318, 25, 3174, 25, 1313, 6912, 198, 35, 546, 10894, 52087, 30100, 358, 1781, 1884, 527, 2212, 1618, 198, 13699, 842, 9008, 18870, 67614, 839, 4363, 3221, 36684, 20103, 44604, 1923, 268, 5654, 2608, 376, 3988, 584, 527, 832, 11, 9615, 584, 527, 1949, 198, 20031, 505, 25, 17177, 44, 371, 285, 389, 6790, 220, 1591, 11, 220, 679, 16, 11, 220, 2545, 25, 1627, 25, 2131, 6912, 198, 7927, 10788, 13, 358, 617, 539, 1027, 22163, 311, 4128, 4205, 627, 7098, 14080, 198, 20031, 505, 25, 37828, 1543, 389, 6790, 220, 1591, 11, 220, 679, 16, 11, 220, 2318, 25, 914, 25, 2148, 6912, 198, 40, 2846, 14792, 445, 10318, 710, 4536, 956, 24784, 11, 2533, 814, 527, 264, 5128, 3062, 86079, 5654, 627, 43, 867, 989, 9523, 311, 3515, 264, 559, 411, 1286, 6864, 3363, 315, 1234, 220, 1041, 11, 931, 7187, 13, 2435, 1120, 649, 956, 31740, 436, 28921, 26907, 627, 19182, 37828, 1543, 5354, 309, 358, 5535, 311, 656, 264, 502, 30328, 3686, 30, 1952, 9420, 11, 499, 1390, 2574, 311, 2586, 505, 704, 315, 279, 51150, 323, 4822, 1070, 13, 10926, 264, 94271, 8063, 627, 20031, 505, 25, 1676, 14080], "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}]}, {"request_id": "3697", "prompt": "Sam is the mother of Kate.

The status quo is strained due to the constant border skirmishes since both sides are embittered by the conflict that resulted from this fleeting unrest.\nIn the years between 850 and 900, the region of Zorvath was conquered and incorporated by Darajan and its neighboring nations. Only Noctari managed to preserve its existence as a small vassal state. It was bound by the Darajan Empire, but largely remained independent. Thus, its current architecture bears the hallmark of the civilization of Noctari, unlike the other existing states. During the disputes that reignited after 950, the new splinter country Quellion declared Tyseria as the state\u2019s heartland. This has led to a radically different architectural style made from white limestone, which is a reminiscence from the old civilization of Darajan and its conquest of Primec before the emergence of Zorvath. Newme, like so many other detached countries, joined the mighty confederation Zorvath, which consisted of Noctari, Primec, and later Darajan. This led to great tensions in the lower Noctarian states in the Morning of every year, the leaders of Zorvath convened at the Jama, the so called \u201eSpring Meetings\u201c. They all eventually gathered in Noctari to solve the problems of their states.\nTurbulent times began after 1000. Zorvath had to deal with the eruption phenomenon of Vythara, which changed the overall climate of the surrounding area. Thus, the people of the Zorvarific region Altiers met with an increasing hardship. Later, Quellion aborted its traditional alliance with Noctari towards Darajan, which could not be verified anymore. This breach in the previously dutiful relationship drove Noctari into great indignation, because Quellion, during the establishment of its borders, had assuredly acquired Noctarian territory. Likewise, the autonomous governorate of Noctari refused to join a new Zorvath confederation when it was formed in 1180.

Gryvus is classified under the family Noctilura. Borithis is classified under the family Fluxilus, thus the statement is true.\nBlathorro, a boiling spring, is a natural phenomenon of baryonors. Chorions are a group of giant lizard creatures that aid its kind in hunting prey. Blathorro poisoning is the name of the lethal side-effect caused by excessive exposure to the contents of the spring. Chorions have been categorized under arthropods because of their exoskeleton. Blathorro is one of the seven boiling natural springs formed during the initial stages of the formation of this planet. The area covered by Blathorro is always found to be covered by vasophyte bushes and lichen algae. The dangerous contents of Blathorro differentiate it from the other six springs because of which occurrence of the phenomenon is severely limited. The \u2018Dragon Crates\u2019 had accidentally unearthed the spring while scouting an area. Fenrith, a historian, had conducted a study on how the geographical formation influenced the quality of the water at the center of the spring. Marla Decatura specializes in Surgery at the Centre of Orbital Sciences. Blathorro poisoning causes an increase in body temperature and burning pain in areas where the spring has touched the body of the person. Formed in the early stages of this planet\u2019s formation, the constantly evolving nature of the spring is of research interest. Blathorro has no proper appearance because of the constant change in the water. Blathorro is directly related to a myth that was formed by the Colorax, about which Grian Schmitt had researched and created a book that shed new light on the history of the bores.

This places Seraphid directly above Moranid and below Gryphonid. Dranthidae is classified under the family Noctilura, which is an older classification than the family Gryvus. This places Dranthidae directly above Noctilura and below Chrysonid. Glacidae is classified under the family Thalorium, which is an older classification than the family Gryvus. This places Glacidae directly above Moranid and below Gryphonid. Zynthor is classified under the family Gryvus, which is the most up-to-date classification. Zynthor is directly above 60 more recently-discovered species, but is below Gryphonid and directly before Gryphonid. Zynthor is considered to be very old.\nThese classifications are not only based on physical appearance, but also on a shared diet. All Kryostis species and Gryvus species eat large amounts of Unrhod, which is a highly toxic fungus native to Mantrix Shallows. Unrhod grows on the bottom of Mantrix Shallows and is covered over by rhythmus during season change. It can only flourish when completely covered by rhythmus. If any shrimps escape this life-giving rhythmus during season change, this will result in a massive die-off among the Esan races. The reason for this toxicity is unknown. It remains, however, that every Gryvus must eat at least one large meal of this lethal fungus before it will start to regenerate. The toxicity of the Unrhod eventually causes the death of every Gryvus. Gryvus species are also notable for their comical mannerisms when eating Unrhod.\nAll members of the Gryvus species are vegetarians. In fact, most species in this family do not have mouths at the normal points of emergence and do not eat during their normal lifespans, relying instead on their prolific production of eggs. During mating, Gryvus couple for this sole purpose, synchronizing their egg production and blending their respective sperm to produce gapless non-genetic clones of the succeeding", "token_ids": [666, 278, 269, 2411, 11, 902, 374, 459, 9191, 24790, 1109, 279, 3070, 99548, 85, 355, 13, 1115, 7634, 8409, 1366, 307, 6089, 3485, 93335, 307, 323, 3770, 99548, 52801, 307, 13, 2999, 32329, 114405, 374, 21771, 1234, 279, 3070, 2360, 302, 321, 5808, 11, 902, 374, 459, 9191, 24790, 1109, 279, 3070, 99548, 85, 355, 13, 1115, 7634, 2999, 32329, 114405, 6089, 3485, 2360, 302, 321, 5808, 323, 3770, 921, 894, 942, 307, 13, 8444, 582, 114405, 374, 21771, 1234, 279, 3070, 666, 278, 269, 2411, 11, 902, 374, 459, 9191, 24790, 1109, 279, 3070, 99548, 85, 355, 13, 1115, 7634, 8444, 582, 114405, 6089, 3485, 93335, 307, 323, 3770, 99548, 52801, 307, 13, 1901, 46909, 269, 374, 21771, 1234, 279, 3070, 99548, 85, 355, 11, 902, 374, 279, 1455, 709, 4791, 18920, 24790, 13, 1901, 46909, 269, 374, 6089, 3485, 220, 1399, 810, 6051, 10694, 21468, 9606, 11, 719, 374, 3770, 99548, 52801, 307, 323, 6089, 1603, 99548, 52801, 307, 13, 1901, 46909, 269, 374, 6646, 311, 387, 1633, 2362, 627, 9673, 96771, 527, 539, 1193, 3196, 389, 7106, 11341, 11, 719, 1101, 389, 264, 6222, 10173, 13, 2052, 735, 894, 537, 285, 9606, 323, 99548, 85, 355, 9606, 8343, 3544, 15055, 315, 1252, 41196, 347, 11, 902, 374, 264, 7701, 21503, 79902, 10068, 311, 52068, 18862, 1443, 56967, 13, 1252, 41196, 347, 28815, 389, 279, 5740, 315, 52068, 18862, 1443, 56967, 323, 374, 9960, 927, 555, 29171, 38827, 2391, 3280, 2349, 13, 1102, 649, 1193, 67784, 994, 6724, 9960, 555, 29171, 38827, 13, 1442, 904, 559, 6417, 1725, 12731, 420, 2324, 2427, 2299, 29171, 38827, 2391, 3280, 2349, 11, 420, 690, 1121, 304, 264, 11191, 2815, 12744, 4315, 279, 9419, 276, 21234, 13, 578, 2944, 369, 420, 58011, 374, 9987, 13, 1102, 8625, 11, 4869, 11, 430, 1475, 99548, 85, 355, 2011, 8343, 520, 3325, 832, 3544, 15496, 315, 420, 45089, 79902, 1603, 433, 690, 1212, 311, 80551, 13, 578, 58011, 315, 279, 1252, 41196, 347, 9778, 11384, 279, 4648, 315, 1475, 99548, 85, 355, 13, 99548, 85, 355, 9606, 527, 1101, 28289, 369, 872, 470, 950, 11827, 13978, 994, 12459, 1252, 41196, 347, 627, 2460, 3697, 315, 279, 99548, 85, 355, 9606, 527, 13294, 30627, 13, 763, 2144, 11, 1455, 9606, 304, 420, 3070, 656, 539, 617, 65609, 520, 279, 4725, 3585, 315, 49179, 323, 656, 539, 8343, 2391, 872, 4725, 10345, 25632, 598, 11, 39661, 4619, 389, 872, 63100, 5788, 315, 19335, 13, 12220, 73219, 11, 99548, 85, 355, 5743, 369, 420, 13612, 7580, 11, 14453, 4954, 872, 19151, 5788, 323, 56941, 872, 20081, 40699, 311, 8356, 13225, 1752, 2536, 37564, 5411, 67007, 315, 279, 73820], "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}]}, {"request_id": "3743", "prompt": "Vynora follows the time zone of Eryndor.

None of the others speak his language.\nThe question thus becomes, how do these nations even have contact with one another? Are there traders talking all of the languages and peddling their eyeshadow?\nIt's just one of those things with a convenient reason, like time in anime going at a slower paced to allow for exposition and angle cuts. It doesn't have to be explained cause it just is; it's not a tradition that someone has to question.\nMy problem is that Ursula/Cynthia wasn't allowed to have real power which is a shame. She's the queen and thus I somewhat expected her to look and act like one. Again, I have no real problems here.\nMy maine issue with H3 is that the whole \"Meeting God isn't good for you\" is dubious. I understand that he's evil (however I could argue that Avril could be described in that way as well), but Charles and Alphonse pointing out that meeting him is bad for you made me pause because it was such an appeal to authority without explaining anything.\nIt also hits both problems I've had with Ursula's treatment in another way. While I don't exactly think it was detrimental to that, it also feels like it's safe writing to someone who's playing a king/queen type character if their position removes their worries and concerns from the decisions they make. You see this also with regards to Alex/Mint.\nHere's the thing, in an anime they can't really prevent Ursula from being the strong leader and executive member of the kingdom. I think it's just as difficult to genuinely and sympathetically write about a character with real power in this series as it is to give the real shit a rest.

In Rubik's Challenge, your progress is used to determine the level you begin on next time you play. There is no new concept to help you progress, just random generated levels. Every time you play, you start with a random start screen and are unable to choose which levels to play until the level is complete and you die.

David wanted to play Rubik's Challenge so he created a YouTube video explaining the strategy he uses to get his best scores. He also included a screenshot of him playing with me.

D\u00e9ric is Zephyrian, and his primary motivation is politics. In Varnexra, the family Varnex (family in the sense that Zephyrians use of the term in social interactions) is traditionally more prestigious. Being an outsider of this family, D\u00e9ric would gain his own prestige in showing that all three of these genera consitute a single family.\nThere is another species within Borithis, Kyianthe. Ultimately, Varnexri is more pissed off about his suggestion that Kyianthe\u2019s genus be reclassified than he was about interbreeding between Zephyrians and Xyphems. Politics is like that sometimes.\nAnyway: Xyphems and Zephyrians are both born in custody with parents and children just about constantly around one another, so that the children of every family witness and become familiar with even non-blood relatives every day. As a Xyphem, I\u2019ve grown up constantly surrounded by Zephyrians. Probably within the past ten or fifteen years there\u2019ve been more Zephyrian families born than Xyphem. So, when my parents converted to Zephyrianism, I viewed that as just one more blip in the constant churn of Xyphem-Zephyrian familial development. Ultimately, this has led some people to comment on how suited I am to living in a Zephyrian point of view. I don\u2019t think I really am, but that\u2019s irrelevant. I am just used to the flow of things.\nThere\u2019s probably something of that attitude baked into the names for the species, I think. Borithis: movement backwards. Varnexri translates as tracks, maybe more in the sense of a trail through the woods. There\u2019s an implication that we are casting tracks, but tracks that nobody can yet see, tracks that lead us backwards, tracks that make us *sound* backwards, but that really go deep.

For those unrevealed, only Tonglia, the head of the Establishment, and her deputies within the Establishment have access. Additionally, some administrators in the Medical Center or one of the other departments that rely on the Establishment for library updates have access as well. There are three doors leading out of building.

In how many ways can the money be received? Explanation The number of ways in which a sum can be paid out in succession depends on the number of people involved and the number of months it takes to receive the full amount. In this case, there are N people, and since the sum is paid out monthly, there are M = 12 months. Therefore, the total number of ways to receive the money is 12C = 12, if calculation is done in cisco packet tracer.\nTide is due two times, one on full moon day and one on new moon day. If the second tide in the illustration below occurs at 4 p.m. on the new moon day. Two days later, when the second tide occurs, which day would it be \u2013 new moon day or full moon day? Explanation Given that the tide is due twice, once on full moon day and the other on new moon day, and the second tide occurred at 4 p.m. on the new moon day. Then two days later, the second tide would occur again. Since there are only new moon and full moon days, the only possible scenario would be that the second tide occurs on the full moon day.\nIf you were captured by an enemy during war and were asked by them on which village hopes and expectations were the highest of you, knowing you, what would you answer?

Because they are located along the equator of Hypolysia, both Glacidae and Tyseria are the only two states with frozen lands. Quellion is also home to many icy rivers, which prompted the city to be named after the word river (quellon being related to 'water'). The meaning of Fendrel is unclear. One possibility is that it is related to the Old Tyserian word Vendra, meaning 'fight', which is exaggerated to Fendrel. 'Smyra' means 'beautiful', most likely referring to Solmyra's natural beauty and cities, making it the \"city of beauty\".

Seraphid and four of his companions Aironn, Aerinth, Kryostis, and Borithis, were placed at the base of the Lighthouse of Serenity. When the team arrived, a message was sent by jackalids to the people of Floria resulling in The Day After The Jackalids. The Day After The Jackalids was the biggest threat to Floria from Clan Negasin. Seraphid questioned about the situation at Floria. However, his friends insisted that the Night of Light could solve everything and rid Flores of Clan Negasin and end this particular threat. But Seraphid wasn't as sure as his friends.\nOn the Night of Light, Seraphid was alone far from the gathering at The Lighthouse of Peace. When the Arkentarian Moon made its appearance in the darkness of the night sky, Savaria caught Seraphid unaware and restrained him. During this, Seraphid tried desperately to get loose and free himself. But Savaria seemed to be rushing time. As the moon eclipsed, Savaria explained what was going to happen next regarding the Night of Light. However, Seraphid did not believe a single word. Minutes before Savaria attacked the day people, Seraphid freed himself from Savaria and made his way to The Lighthouse of Peace.\nInfluenced by Savaria, Glacidae was working with the jackalids to capture the guys. Once at the scene, Seraphid instantly saw that Aerinth was captured and accidentally stabbed Glacidae with his blade. Settling up a final battle, Glacidae was able to win and Seraphid was captured.\nAntiderus arrived at the scene of the battle and used the Djinn to try to convince Aironn that they should make amends. Aironn refused and threatened Seraphid's life. Unmoved, Antiderus cut off Aironn's wing and was then targeted by the combined force of the jackalids.

Attacks on Havroth will require a declaration of war within the year 2000. There are, of course, ways around this, and so the warlike factions inside Zorvath have declared military adventurism until late 2075. Vesperon is a NAP ally of Dras. Dras was the only nation with a functional army at the time Vesperon established this relationship. I am not a lawyer, but I believe this means a declaration of war is not necessary for Zorvath to assist Havroth in their assault on Vesperon. Therefore, Zorvath military adventurism will obtain a strategic advantage. Since everything is reversed, Vesperon has declared war against Havroth.

While it must be learned either by communication with those who have learned to speak it or by communicating with phonoubaines to understand its basic phonemes, it allows a speaker to learn to speak a language in a vast span of time solely with extrapolation from \u201creal life\u201d experiences. Even an individual without the ability to properly apply language to the world can be helped by a language-speaker. Only grocerous, arg\u00ebirians, motryn, and serraneons have the ability to edume to a language. If more than 60 percent of the population of a land have learned to speak a language well, that language is typically used in that land. The majority of lands have multiple native tongues (with most Austrorians also speaking Primax most often for business, the Quallian clans their mother tongues, though each region has a predominating tongue, the Ki\u2019\u00fbat speaking other languages than Kaiia, and so forth), though almost all Austrorians, Folkritians, and V\u00e2dra\u00fbn use Primax almost universally and Bahrun most often, Bonchten, Novros, and Ruskorn almost completely use Old Common, B\u00e2rdonians, Bellors, and Havelarr Ruptian, and both Ekranrians, Idstanans, and Makar\u00eeeans Arb\u00ebrish.

Incoherent scattering is the most common one, and that's the only one we have to deal with. As long as the wiggicaly disturbed electrons in radioactive material have an amplitude of less than 100mV, they are too small to contain moving charges, and do not scatter the radiation at all.\nOne of the main distinctions between emission and absorption spectra is the breadth of lines in absorption spectra compared to emission spectrum. Why does the absorption spectrum has broader line?\nRadiation scatters less through the air in from of an light source than an absorber can absorb a relatively large amount of light as a scattered product. One of the best way to narrow down the frequency is to increase the amount of scattered light wiped out to the from of a light source, as a product is the monochromatic origin, represents a strong background of the absorber. This method is only prone to the shift of broad lines, as an overly larger absorption peak is generally removed before omitting an overly large percentage of the rest.\nIn transmission spectra, an interfering absorber factor increases in width to approximate to the bandwidth, and this is taken into broad lines.\nResonance splitting is the consequence of the interacting two free neutral bosons(\"atoms\") that change from two free, symmetrical species into two individual symmetrical superpartners. The most notable example of resonance splitting is the altered state of a gas molecule: if it is substituted by a neutral substance, it will split into two parts, with a mass to \"split\" being, for example, between 0.1% and 0.5%.\nWhen measuring scattering in these terms, atomic electrons are produced and encountered the electromagnetic resistance (near the nucleus) at which the scales", "token_ids": [45170, 627, 11458, 11, 9210, 374, 539, 3284, 627, 10445, 374, 18803, 64069, 72916, 3062, 198, 30287, 4238, 72916, 374, 279, 1401, 5507, 369, 279, 44032, 315, 36021, 57077, 6956, 323, 34494, 26168, 627, 83224, 439, 279, 59862, 12330, 6688, 704, 555, 279, 2592, 374, 6646, 311, 387, 56887, 11, 1148, 374, 279, 6811, 1990, 56887, 323, 304, 1030, 38638, 72916, 18072, 644, 1030, 38638, 2445, 31436, 374, 264, 3169, 315, 72916, 304, 902, 279, 5030, 374, 539, 56507, 11, 323, 912, 289, 20831, 398, 11633, 374, 3970, 1457, 2949, 279, 12330, 13, 763, 1030, 38638, 72916, 374, 279, 1455, 4279, 832, 11, 323, 430, 596, 279, 1193, 832, 584, 617, 311, 3568, 449, 13, 1666, 1317, 439, 279, 289, 20831, 950, 88, 56507, 57678, 304, 59862, 3769, 617, 459, 45209, 315, 2753, 1109, 220, 1041, 76, 53, 11, 814, 527, 2288, 2678, 311, 6782, 7366, 10405, 11, 323, 656, 539, 45577, 279, 25407, 520, 682, 627, 4054, 315, 279, 1925, 87259, 1990, 41353, 323, 44225, 63697, 374, 279, 58321, 315, 5238, 304, 44225, 63697, 7863, 311, 41353, 20326, 13, 8595, 1587, 279, 44225, 20326, 706, 27927, 1584, 5380, 75246, 367, 1156, 10385, 2753, 1555, 279, 3805, 304, 505, 315, 459, 3177, 2592, 1109, 459, 15938, 655, 649, 35406, 264, 12309, 3544, 3392, 315, 3177, 439, 264, 38067, 2027, 13, 3861, 315, 279, 1888, 1648, 311, 15376, 1523, 279, 11900, 374, 311, 5376, 279, 3392, 315, 38067, 3177, 49266, 704, 311, 279, 505, 315, 264, 3177, 2592, 11, 439, 264, 2027, 374, 279, 1647, 5059, 99866, 6371, 11, 11105, 264, 3831, 4092, 315, 279, 15938, 655, 13, 1115, 1749, 374, 1193, 38097, 311, 279, 6541, 315, 7353, 5238, 11, 439, 459, 39532, 8294, 44225, 16557, 374, 8965, 7108, 1603, 52144, 1303, 459, 39532, 3544, 11668, 315, 279, 2800, 627, 644, 18874, 63697, 11, 459, 75387, 15938, 655, 8331, 12992, 304, 2430, 311, 45968, 311, 279, 34494, 11, 323, 420, 374, 4529, 1139, 7353, 5238, 627, 1079, 263, 685, 45473, 374, 279, 29774, 315, 279, 45830, 1403, 1949, 21277, 43746, 2439, 446, 66650, 909, 430, 2349, 505, 1403, 1949, 11, 8045, 59402, 9606, 1139, 1403, 3927, 8045, 59402, 2307, 98131, 13, 578, 1455, 28289, 3187, 315, 58081, 45473, 374, 279, 29852, 1614, 315, 264, 6962, 43030, 25, 422, 433, 374, 63196, 555, 264, 21277, 20278, 11, 433, 690, 6859, 1139, 1403, 5596, 11, 449, 264, 3148, 311, 330, 7105, 1, 1694, 11, 369, 3187, 11, 1990, 220, 15, 13, 16, 4, 323, 220, 15, 13, 20, 126437, 4599, 30090, 72916, 304, 1521, 3878, 11, 25524, 57678, 527, 9124, 323, 23926, 279, 66669, 13957, 320, 52759, 279, 62607, 8, 520, 902, 279, 29505], "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}]}, {"request_id": "3872", "prompt": "Uthrelin is a species in the genus Dranthidae.

It was told that once this girl looked for a rare item related to sorcery, called Noctaru. Noctaru is a rare item. Only genius or sorcerer who had mastered the highest rank can manufacture it. Whoever uses it will know it because they can dream of specific things. Because of the rareness, anyone going to this area will be caught by sorcerer to produce items, but the items are not bestowed to the person even if they complete the task successfully. Every items that they could get, with the knowledge they get could prove, were they had tasted enough suffering which only consider worthy enough by sorcerer to give a clue. Once, a short haired girl was assigned to look for a red stone in the gorge. When the deadline was over, sorcerer started their plan, dragged the girl to a lake and threw her into the water around. The girl was frightened and angry. When she was struggling against the strong current, a floating spot caught her attention in the bottom of the lake. She seemed out of luck anyway because she did only need to dive quickly to reach the bottom of the lake. What the girl tried was successful. She was able to grab the floating spot.

Afternoons of goal and evenings of power are named after the way the moon typically appears around that time.\nWhen properly aligned, the Three Moons appear to be separate satellites of each other. One moon (mother) rotates around luminary, and a smaller one (daughter) around mother.

This makes for a total of twentyones days in the daughter moon cycle.\nThe mother usually has thirty-six degrees, but this swells to forty when zetaomai is synchronous with the daughter\u2019s slack phase. The effects of moon phases on morning, afternoon, and evening are not affected by the mother moon\u2019s rotation.\nWhen the moons do not align, days are numbered.

The only shortage of problem is that more than 3 brothers are mentioned.\nI can not agree with \"J\" that answer is wrong because it requires 3 or 4 fathers. Either way, four is the max, possible by having one father marrying two different sisters. But then there are more that four people than just fathers and sons. I interpret the brother part of father as a person has at least one brother, which does not mean the brother(s) are mentioned.\nUsing the same reasoning, \"A\" answer can not be right because the most possible brothers are 3. If one brother is not mentioned, then there will be more than 3 brothers, which requires 4, which is not possible. Thus, \"A\" requires the brothers be mentioned and \"B\" does not. Which kind of seems like a contradiction???

He married Chrysothemis, the daughter of Calliphon of Aulis, in an arranged marriage. He agreed with Galen that the regulation of human health is a matter which required the recourse to medical science. He established in his academy at Aulis a system of ethics which reached the schools of the Catholic Church. His \u201cThrepti\u201d and his \u201cZomenia\u201d were the first characteristics of the greatest thoughts of \u201cEllenina\u201d to the rest of the world and are among the most ancient extant works of pure philosophy.\nThe school taught the theory of the nomos, or discipline in the ordinary course of nature and was opposed to the schools of the Rhapsodists and Sophists. The latter taught an irregular course of life and sought to defeat the solid discipline of the Apeiros Theriac. Because of his close relations with Chrysothemis, it is natural that his medical practice was associated with her treatment of the various mental diseases of those in her care. From his teachings, he established the rules of a more gentle regime in the treatment of these maladies and was based on a sound mental observation by the athletes such as Spartacus.\nAccording to the later Greek works, Alcmaeon was the ideal of self-denial.

The continent Eril is the size of North America.\nLabel the following landforms: Mesophere (greenhouse), Ozone, Stratophere (ionosphere), Vesperon Rock, Ocean currents, and Eythirian Hills. Vesperon Rock is a large rock formation between Umbrithis and Eryndor. The ocean currents are in the Northern Atlantic Ocean. Eythirian Hills is a mountain chain between Eril and Xionia. Mesophere is the middle atmospheric layer between stratopthere and troposphere. Ozone is the highest atmospheric layer protecting us from ultraviolet radiation.

Glacier erosion in under Bridgeport Crater and under Lava Dome. Ocean currents aren't created by glaciers or wind. Tectonic forces cause earthquakes under the fault lines and volcanoes are anywhere. Volcanoes underneath glaciers aren't possible.\nThe Northern hemisphere peaks will definitely experience more precipitation because of the glaciers melting into the ocean, which results in higher rainfall. This will effect all the plants and vegetation growing around the border of the glacier. These plants and vegetation will expand and upwards upwards slowly as the glacier melts further, allowing for a more flat land next to the glacier.\nThere is more plant life in the holes than the rest of the glacier because of the snowfall and rainfall in the hole, allowing for firm ground where snow and ice will not exist. This will lead to forming more land as the plants grow, which allows more calving of the glacier. The plants also form water channels which will release water when the glacier melts.\nClimatic change will drastically change the environment in and around the tar pits. The earth could go through an ice age, increasing the rate of ice accumulation around the pit. The temperature may change, which will instantaneously affect the whole ecosystem.

The famous Gallop and future supporter of the Revolutionary Council helped craft the show. They were the largest economic hit in the Vynora Glacidae Varagoni Wars. 578 Trillion Gbul was realized in sales from the fighting between the two countries during the early 2100's. Vykxxxa Sev affected the war when he joined up with the troupes repping the home town of Noctari. At the time, he was making millions from a toymaker chain, Abraxadabra Unfortunately, the war wrecked much but it also gave many families work and more money elsewhere. Concerts were also a big part of the growth of Moyvelaran. Huge operations of stages etc. were set up along waterways to entertain many soldiers. Sadly in the mid of war, a local band, Bacchus burst out and smashed through fame landing gigs across the map including Sev's show. The crowds had just streamed in thanks to bruves. These concerts would be praised in the Eryndor Theatre world for many years. Quantrax later made a group of revolutionary sailors who worked with Traviist and Perdue. As an admiral at the time, Mordios had this competition. Some other naval commanders were somehow part of the dynamic too. The famous Trazorm Armament Soldier, Willy Willy the Great made millions on the side in the war through book sales, bracelet advertising, and even developing a way through a mining / trapping venture for rivers rats while making rumors of being a skilled Stoakbum runner. These funds combined with his funny singing (I'd string her on a Pike) fame made wars based conglomerate such as Xanati turn to either conquer or ally with Willy in return for loot. The purity of his album Faker made him/iconic however. In addition, his notoriety boosted some arms sales nationally. Clovershit Is a musical collective led by Simic.

Each person has only one \"friend.\" Asked to arrange the four people into a row such that each person appears \"next to\" their friend, they happen to generate the rows L - A - L - U and L - L - L - L. Which permutation must have need to have generated? Explanation: Remembering the pattern 'fox/fox' rule, we can find out the common pattern to generate this series. 'L' contains 'f' and 'L' 'L' contains 's' and 'L' 'U' contains 'L' and 'o'. So we need the word which contains 'L' and 'o'. 'Lucy' is the only word containing both 'L' and 'o'. Thus, Lucy is the only person who is the friend of Luke (L-L-L-L).\nConsider the following sequence of numbers: 6 7 8 7 4 5. What is the next number in the series?

We only know that there are four mothers, e.g., Peter, Lucy, Luke, and Alice. We don't know how many fathers we have.\nPeter is definitely a man, but we don't know how many people have the first name Peter. If we assume that 'the first man we know in the puzzle' can only be Peter then we do not know who fathered Kate (or Lucy, though you need Alice to include Kate).\nI don't think the statement in the question about Mrs X is very helpful. There are quite a few examples of people who have no children or who have died without children.\nYou can 'pick a name' then but that will potentially disqualify you. For instance someone picking Lucy as the 4th woman will discover later that Lucy is not a mother because Lucy's son Mark is a mother.\nOn the other hand, the wording given invites you to do this so long as you do not pick a name no one else might reasonably assume is in the puzzle. We don't 'pick' Lucy, we merely visit Peter at home and meet Lucy, then check a bunch of other things.\nClearly Peter is male; keep in mind, though, that there is no Adam and Eve.

Answer: In the noun Andrew, there are no significant gender markers, all nouns can be masculine or feminine. Look at the following sentence: Arriving at the station, Andrew groped his way, clutching his suitcase. The difference between the adjective and the noun is their grammatical status. What Is AKAKID A quick quiz before delving into the matter: Complete the following sentence without using comma? \"My cat is fat but (like a tub of lard, but she is beautiful too, I love / How fat is your cat? I can't get the cat to curl around my shoulders. - She has already gained over 4kg and her high carbohydrates diet isn't helping. How many rodents can live in a hamster bulb? What the hell is happening to the hamsters' - diet is composed of junk. Maybe the babid is a bit bigger than the bunny?\nHow to Make a Sentence\nThe longest addition to the bottom of the sentence, which already contains a quotation, consists of a quote and a comma. That date started three centuries later, but it was enough for me. Inserting a period at the end of a quote shows that it is the final part of a sentence, while placing a comma before the opening quotation mark means the sentence is linked to the sentence. A semicolon is sometimes interchangeable with other punctuation marks, such as a colon. Compare the following two sentences: She shouted angrily in the shadow of the castle, making sure no one would hear her; She shouted angrily in the shadow of the castle, making sure that no one would hear her.\nWhat is a Causal Link?
