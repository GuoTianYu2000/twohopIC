The Dranthidae are around the gravity and their age around 4 to 6 years, which means the superstars are slowly aging.

Normally every noble member has a dual set of wings and a two bead beak. The type of twin firefly keeps them sealed and protected and well.

It had long been assumed to have gone extinct, when a lone Uthrelin specimen was spotted and studied. The scientist team realised these were not the same species as the previous Eastern Xyphidon specimens had been designated. This completely separate species was christened \"Uthrelin,\" but following the reclassification of Zephira the name \"Uthrelin\" was given to the genus, and Varilon Yvorith renamed to Yvorith. Due to its association with the highest mountains and Avile, it remains prevalent only in the southeast part of the continent and in the mountains, being fairly easy to ID with its large size. It is measured at over 7.5 feet of length.

This is a contradiction of the statement's initial use of the English word for gender and cannot necessarily logically represent the statement.\nThe reasoning behind this answer is simple. Each parent has to be a parent, so having a father or a mother implies that they are a parent. If A is the parent of B, then B must be the child of A. Even though this must be true, suppose that Jack is Anna's father. In that case, he is both a grandfather and the grandfather of his mother, Anna.

Jack is the father of Max, so he is a grandfather through Max, who is the father of John. Since it requires that someone\u2019s father be the grandfather in order to be their father in this paradox, then you must have to have to have at least three people in the family line.

This area also avoid extreme weather once in a blue moon which incidentally also covered the area. The distribution of atmospheric water would be pushed further north as it get closer to be getting separated north and south latitudes poleward. If it's Equatorial on one side and Tropic on the other.

Current US Military policy for Special Forces offers graduates the option to go through a direct commission program that offers a guaranteed commission at their current rank or retire from the military at the age of 30 following service. The USMC, UCP, and Army races gave me the chance to pursue a leadership role in Special Forces and pursue a higher top 5 promotion down the road from there. The special forces rank of E-5 is a very good rank to have because it is relatively secure, competitive, and offers some downward mobility. While infinitely less scary than a direct commission program, there is an aspect of risk to this path.\nA commission program is often the targeted goal for individuals seeking a higher upper rank, but very few make it within the competitive confines of the ranks surrounding them. Alternatively, being a Sup Sgt will allow for significant upward mobility \u2019finding their most optimal job without having as many downstream dependencies.\nThe idea is that if you recruit someone to the Special Forces Program and they join as an E-5, If they perform well they will receive a commission. Enlisting members joining a commission will always be better paid for special forces, which would significantly reduce the overall cost of either option. If they do not, they could stay on as an E-5 Sup Sgt, which gives them the security and options for upward mobility enjoyed by Sup Sgt.

Paul is also a mother, so, her son or daughter is a female, as well, Kate. And the biological grandparenting happens on a female, as it is Kg, considering that the parental genetic is 50% by 50% for each the parents, Kg can be assured only from a female, no matter a female is an egg or a sperm. Since Jack is the father and is a female, he being a mother is assured and hence Joe is a female.

The Guardians of the Faith drill is unique, for it requires the soldiers to ground themselves in the sign of the One God -- in which troops place their boot heel upon the Medals of Valor.

Start with choosing your rafting outfit (one size fits not all); the paddling crew has to be aware of safety issues; physical preparation becomes most important in this preparation phase; consume lots of water, especially the morning of the trip; use sunscreen (you will be needing it with the amount of time you are going to spend in the sun and it is not going to be a balanced day); wear waterproof cameras since you will not want to miss any opportunity for making this your cherish trip. Also able to find a pair sunglasses or glasses and be careful on how much sunscreen you will be smoking, this is important when taking on this wonderful experience.

Emma speaks Turkish. Sarah speaks Arabic.\nA. no\nB. yes\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: Languages are closely connected to locations. People who speak the same language often live in the same place.\nPeople with different languages can communicate by translating between languages.\nLanguages can change over time. This often happens when two communities mix. For example, people from one community may move to a new place where a different community lives. The language of the new community can change because of the translation and mixed speaking practice.\nCommunities can also learn about new languages and add words from other languages. For example, technology and trading bring people into contact with each other. This can lead to new words being added to the community language. For example, many communities now use the English words Internet and email. These words have been translated into many languages, such as Arabic, Russian, and Welsh.\nTwo community languages can also mix and become a new mixed language. For example, a community of enslaved Africans in the descendant community of Suriname learned the language of their enslavers, Dutch. Over time, this led to the creation of a new language called Ndjuka. Ndjuka has some similarities with Dutch and some with African languages.", "token_ids": [8690, 13, 36035, 21881, 24666, 13, 21077, 21881, 35217, 627, 32, 13, 912, 198, 33, 13, 10035, 198, 16533, 25, 362, 198, 70869, 25, 56064, 527, 15499, 8599, 311, 10687, 13, 9029, 889, 6604, 279, 1890, 4221, 3629, 3974, 304, 279, 1890, 2035, 627, 16298, 449, 2204, 15823, 649, 19570, 555, 67371, 1990, 15823, 627, 60386, 649, 2349, 927, 892, 13, 1115, 3629, 8741, 994, 1403, 10977, 6651, 13, 1789, 3187, 11, 1274, 505, 832, 4029, 1253, 3351, 311, 264, 502, 2035, 1405, 264, 2204, 4029, 6439, 13, 578, 4221, 315, 279, 502, 4029, 649, 2349, 1606, 315, 279, 14807, 323, 9709, 12365, 6725, 627, 18461, 6165, 649, 1101, 4048, 922, 502, 15823, 323, 923, 4339, 505, 1023, 15823, 13, 1789, 3187, 11, 5557, 323, 11380, 4546, 1274, 1139, 3729, 449, 1855, 1023, 13, 1115, 649, 3063, 311, 502, 4339, 1694, 3779, 311, 279, 4029, 4221, 13, 1789, 3187, 11, 1690, 10977, 1457, 1005, 279, 6498, 4339, 8191, 323, 2613, 13, 4314, 4339, 617, 1027, 25548, 1139, 1690, 15823, 11, 1778, 439, 35217, 11, 8690, 11, 323, 46881, 627, 11874, 4029, 15823, 649, 1101, 6651, 323, 3719, 264, 502, 9709, 4221, 13, 1789, 3187, 11, 264, 4029, 315, 95389, 66738, 304, 279, 76951, 4029, 315, 8242, 80956, 9687, 279, 4221, 315, 872, 67548, 22292, 11, 24113, 13, 6193, 892, 11, 420, 6197, 311, 279, 9886, 315, 264, 502, 4221, 2663, 452, 78604, 26261, 13, 452, 78604, 26261, 706, 1063, 43874, 449, 24113, 323, 1063, 449, 11904, 15823, 13, 128001], "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}]}, {"request_id": "2149", "prompt": "Grace is the father of John.

When the same product is multiplied by different factors, by changing the sign as necessary, the values cancel out. The net value of the products will show the final answer. For this problem, if there is no restriction on the value of x, then 0/-8 is ignored because no two factors can result in a negative product. The solution will have a value of either 0 or 8.\nThis can be done by creating a T-Chart and listing the values for \u221a(y-25), and the possible values of y for a square root. These values will cancel out. The greatest value of \u221a(y-25) is 5, and the least value is -5. The square of 5 is 25. The square of -5 is 25, and the square root of 25 is 5.\nStatement (2) alone is insufficient because there is no information about the value for y. Statement (1) alone is insufficient, as there are only two solutions: \u221a(y-25) and -\u221a(y-25). There are no restrictions given as to which square root should be chosen.

Zephyras differ, because they have hind limbs that do not split into separate tails.\nThis page was last modified on 14 August 2010, at 19:08.", "token_ids": [23768, 411, 285, 627, 791, 1167, 97353, 26692, 527, 264, 3544, 1912, 315, 296, 8322, 461, 4908, 9606, 430, 4430, 264, 29142, 24725, 9986, 86567, 55443, 750, 1139, 91529, 37798, 91346, 8839, 430, 9025, 4920, 279, 17661, 13, 9062, 1167, 97353, 2298, 706, 2204, 48694, 49892, 11, 279, 1403, 9606, 584, 649, 10356, 369, 2771, 3515, 24210, 11977, 1109, 14535, 26, 279, 14535, 527, 73152, 3544, 389, 1630, 88, 764, 77152, 323, 2678, 389, 8444, 582, 114405, 13, 578, 1343, 269, 85, 1122, 369, 1063, 2944, 617, 872, 6859, 64614, 311, 279, 14981, 11, 1418, 279, 32732, 411, 5493, 617, 48301, 389, 279, 11314, 13, 763, 8444, 582, 114405, 11, 279, 6859, 9986, 389, 1202, 2547, 374, 1120, 1403, 15792, 51760, 11, 719, 389, 279, 49695, 279, 6859, 9986, 9221, 459, 5150, 743, 315, 1403, 1317, 64614, 11, 56085, 315, 264, 93101, 321, 5808, 596, 64614, 13, 1901, 97353, 13075, 1782, 11, 1606, 814, 617, 48419, 49695, 430, 656, 539, 6859, 1139, 8821, 64614, 627, 2028, 2199, 574, 1566, 11041, 389, 220, 975, 6287, 220, 679, 15, 11, 520, 220, 777, 25, 2318, 13, 128001], "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}]}, {"request_id": "2177", "prompt": "Fendrel is a city in the state of Marendor.

Next to each name, you also write down the \u2018position\u2019 (father, mother, or a grandparent) and relate them accordingly.\nAnswer: D - Mark is only mentioned one time, but Anna is not.\nAssume Joe is \u201cthe father of Jane\u201d or \u201cthe son of Paul.\u201d\nAccording to your assumptions, Mark is the grandfather of Anna. (If you prefer, you can ignore \u201cPaul and Jane\u201d rule out \\ with a guess E)\nIf \u201cBen is the son of Joe,\u201d then \u201cBen is the grandson of Kate and Sam.\u201d\n\u201cBen was born after Sarah\u201d makes this question easier (E is incorrect).\nPlease observe the correct positions: father, mother or a grandparent.

Since all the children are of opposite sex, they must be born from oppositely femaler mothere and father. This is not true for Jeff, so D is not possible.

Once the wizard identify spell has been cast by one of the heroes in the current loading the time line still flows through the same point in time as it would have without any identify spell casting. Morever, you will need to cast powerful enough spells to identify most things as otherwise it will become impossible to realize how a certain item actually works. With the powerful identify spell you will fully learn not only the item's name but also it's features and origin. Anybody else in the world can now learn this too by just reading a book. In order for this rule to hold (the time line progresses even if you cast an identify spell) you must perform all your wizard spells on a whole profession and with a full time status. You only need one chance to do so. If you don't cast any further magic between your beginning and your end you don't need to be aware of how the time flows.\nThe corresponding gods of the universe added a var/cache directory in the new submodules.

They all have certain basic properties, though, depending on how they\u2019re defined and what exactly they look like. For example, all the circles in Isaac\u2019s exploration of the topology of the unit circle are exactly one unit wide. Some of them are entirely contained within the interior of the circle, some of them traverse either the circle or other components of the coordinate system completely, and some of them are a mix of both.\nThat prompted me to look for a concept or construction in topology before that which digs down into questions like covering and winding. Another one which felt like a good choice was \u201cplane\u201d. A plane can be everything from the interior of a ball to the surface of a ball to \u201couter space\u201d and of course even from the interior and surface of a sphere to the surface of a torus.

The sprites don\u2019t even realize the fact that they have a whole planet near them. So they don\u2019t mind sharing the planet with a different race. There were a few small conflicts in which the sprites wanted a house built, but the islanders of Thaloria weren\u2019t doing it.

Havroth is the same as Fendrel.\nIt goes **(Melmerly:)** (more or less) like this. Lets take Nen-Zel, for instance.\nYour Cerro Face has been triggered, and you're preeverted into a different 'place' so to speak, which might be guarded by the Ankaran Holy Cult. When you leave the place, i.e. exit the WWW page or whatever, the the Cerro countdown enters a waiting state, or some state the isn't actually in a countdown phase anymore. The timer gets clocked to live, freezing the countdown process. When you actually do exit and log in, the countdown process is started again, bearing in mind how much time you spent in the quest, and the timer stops once more. This process repeats while you're logged in..with the counter increasing every time. Once the countdown process finishes, a 'bonus' appears, and the quest 'deleted', which pushes the PTR timer to launch a reset, which will re-trigger the payroll process of the quest, once again creating the Cerro Face Payroll as a result.\nWhat this means, is that the cerro count is **not** actually actually in a countdown phase once you're outside of the context of the quest. Therefore, it is possible to pace out your time longer, and that will result in a longer duration for the initial 'bonus' before the PTR timerInitiates a reset.

If circles do not overlap, it means that the information in each circle is different. Sienna and Bailey are best friends. The diagram shows the best friends Sienna and Bailey have. Place the information in the diagram.\nSienna's best friends all go to the same school as Sienna. So, information about schools overlaps in all three circles. Bailey's school is different from Sienna's school. So, the information about Bailey's school does not overlap with the other information. Hershey's school is the same as Bailey's school. So, the information about Hershey's school overlaps with the information about Bailey's school.\nTherefore, the correct diagram is shown below. People in Tyseria do not speak Korean. People in Glacidae speak Korean. People in Umbrithis speak Hebrew. Information about people in Glacidae overlaps with information about people in Umbrithis because Glacidae and Umbrithis are different countries.

Based on some other textbooks, in order to maximize the wind flow over the wing, the wind flows preferably from underneath top of the wing. Nonetheless, the analyses created by Leakey and also the others demonstrated that provided sufficient airflow entering the massive body of water tail (not eliminating imbalance), it's totally possible, so that you can improve the glide rate of being a water drop-tail (Leakey and co-authors 1946). In 1987, that plethora of observations and analyses has also been utilized by Guinness. This Guinness booklet asserts that \"since it's filamentary, a spider's net aerodynamically does function as a wing\" (Guinness 87). The text of their Listing Web Page emphasizes that a piece of shieley from a spider's world wide web declines falling may be due to the frontal area (or the level of cross-section area of this barricade) because the wing's tight span (Precisely the Same Trend 2008). In just about any transverse runway a wing or even a barricade with lower frontal area possesses advantage.

This holds true except when there is a single generation (as with Adam & Eve and Noctari), in which case it is calculated as 48 being 2(23). Therefore, the sharkies that occur are a simple doubling in the number of ancestors. This also holds true for the descendants, but the primal brothers paradox leaves us with a factor of 2 for the number of individuals to be produced during the generation where babies were born. The numbers given by relation after Noah have at most 2 siblings until Adam. After that point, there is a shock of growth with respect to the number of generations.\nWhat this means, therefore, is that during every doubling before Adam, the number of ancestors after descent neuron crams goes up by 4.

The signal identity on myralin is that it is nocturnal. Myralin requires a lot of water and room to move around (myralin is a social animal), but still likes to have a secluded place to call home. Myralins tend to build the nooks and crevices of a spacecraft. Myralins expose infected skin by the prolonged exposure to the Melah. Myralins are the only species that can survive on the Melah.\nMyralins are the most intelligent of the Glacidae. Most consist of information known about planets and solid map information such as asteroid ranges or ranges of radiation. In times of hardship, a Myralin can teach entire spacecraft to avoid certain predators or where to find food over a loudspeaker. Myralins are notoriously shy creatures and can easily be scared away by bright space vessels. Because the Glacidae have an affinity for water, the Myralin is one of the few species which has displayed romantic contact. Myralins mate for life and each will attack the one holding the other immature or young. Myralin life spans are unknown.

It is most commonly found in groups of 5-10 animals, although it is more rarely found in groups of 5-10 or more. Its most common form is a long, thick plant with a single leaf at the top, with a single flower bud on the ground beneath the top leaf. It is a large, heavy, round leaf that is about 3 feet long.\nBorithis is also known as a \u201ctree of life\u201d because it contains the seeds of many plants, which in turn are the seeds of life. For this reason, Borithis is most popular with lumberjacks, who use Borithis seeds to create wooden containers for storing lumber. The leaves of Borithis contain a variety of useful chemicals that help to maintain the overall health of the plant.\nBorithis is a member of the Drondillidae family, which has the seed of Borithis on the outside of the seed. The inside of the seed, called the stamen, contains tubes that transport nutrients to the inside of the leaves, and when the stamen dies the tube makes its way to the next plant.

To argue that it is semantic category we are to use to reason about this is to commit a taxonomic fallacy. It is no different in principle from reasoning about a biological population. The genetic information (they ultimately say) is contained in a DNA sequence--there are a few intervening steps--that can be said to carry information for a wide range of phenotypes. But it seems pretty obvious that DNA sequences are not, or are not only, where garbage in/garbage out thinking establishes the tremendous importance of identifying what the appropriate domain of inference happens to be--for this is true, no matter what the persisting thing being studied happens to be. Solution: m-u-s-t operate within a closed system. (Following Kauffman, cognition has something to do with causality, where order arises out of chaos, and randomness.) Central to this argument is the ability to reason rigorously about replaying an experiment many times. Brillouin imagined watching a given transaction N times: each time, he would register a value--not the transaction itself, but the sequence of values, \\(\\Sigma\\)X sub i\\(\\alpha\\). Clearly significant transactions stand out. Now, ambivalence seems to be--arguably--a result of such a process. However, this is not just an issue of the instructive part of the kombinatorial yield of experiment pile-on. This is Shannon's problem as well.

The Shapers called these immortal guardians, speculation as to who was who was unknown, the directional. Fendrel, the Sun, had three children with three lesser gods. From him was born the directional of east, Quellion. Fendrel swears he never had children. It is for this reason he is known as \u201cthe villain\u201d.

Windwalkerism was a commonly accepted philosophy even among the gods, since the gods (save perhaps for Quellion) were windwalkers as well. This lasted until the formation of Balthorien, which sought to unify with the four winds and succeed where they failed. This spark ignited the Modelinean Wars. Balthorien was defeated badly.

From Fig. 10.8, we see that the ancient seahorses acquired the capacity for echolocation by the time the Thalorium species appeared. When the Kryostis was formed, it inherited the capacity for echolocation. By definition, all members of Kryostis have the capacity to echo-locate. Therefore, even the extinct Glacidae had the capacity for echolocation. During the latter Cenozoic, the Kryostis family nearly went extinct. Some surviving members of the Kleptoscorpii genus laid breeding eggs, but the young are born homeless and spend the rest of their lives migrating over the ocean currents for the opportunity to lay eggs. When born, a young klepto is entirely yellow in colour. However, as soon as it consumes the prey, it turns blue for the rest of its life. Young kleptos rarely ever grow up and lay eggs due to the extreme migration conducted by the Kleptoscorpii.\nThe Kleptoscorpii genus belongs to the Kryostis family and therefore has the capacity for echolocation. Adult kleptos rarely feed after they are fully grown and travel over the ocean currents for the sake of laying eggs. This year, it was suggested that an echo-locating mechanism is highly sensitive to changes in the sonar output of adult kleptos. Though sonar is well studied in the scientific community, the small chambers below the head structure of kleptos are incompletely understood. Most kleptos, upon being caught by fishermen, exhibit strong reflexes and move in a burly manner, making it difficult to measure brain features.

These go through the roof due to the stress on all components. But if they were used say, only on the shortest legs or when being faster is absolutely vital, they may be profitible. Overall though, they will never dominate the sky, at least not if there is any competition from supersonic railguns. This sounds a bit like reading some John Wiswell stories with a few differences. The purple-world analogy returns but you have a bit of time travel thrown in. It\u2019s not bad but you can pick up some of Wiswell\u2019s stuff if you haven\u2019t already.\nHello suiomenceti.

Both the mother and the father are responsible for passing on the recessive gene of the Larson's and the receptors to the other family members in the tree. Since the brother and sister married each other, both the mother and the father are described in a relatively similiar way in the problem (besides not having the same name obviously).\nI chose B: \"Ruby is the father of Kate.

John and Sarah don't speak each other's languages.\nStarting with the premise that everyone speaks their language perfectly and has the opportunity of learning others, my project requires that people communicate with only those they speak the same language as. They can find out about others through headlines, but must find out the same information that everyone else in their language communication group does; to avoid the conundrum of those who know less coming into contact with those who know more while the former two do not, but are gossiping about the latter. Speakers may then enter governments and political parties that represent their interests. In order to get elected, they must connect to other parties in their language community. All 3 political entities must then negotiate by discussing the issues affecting their languages, eventually co-creating new ideas and innovations which satisfy all. This is due to limitations on time and space.\nThis project stems from observations of people who use their phones at the same time as a person who speaks their language is talking.\nSome examples of both issues and sources of these solutions include:\n* Moving to cities has increased speech production due to careers that\n \u00a0 \u00a0deal with people, increased distance between home and workplace, and larger\n \u00a0 \u00a0social groups\n* Cars increased communication production frequencies due to multiple drivers\n \u00a0 \u00a0per household, and single-driver households needing them in the suburbs\n* TV has decreased language production\n* Both cars and TVs have decreased face-to-face communication\nCommunication frequency is proportional to its speed.

However, Zynthor has the greatest speed of all three due to its powerful flight muscles. The classification of species is finalized by the attributes of their different wings. When necessary, all species can fly months without landing on the Earth and also, though the short wings of Varnex, their flight is regarded as the fastest speed in the universe.\nUnlike the species of Dranthidae (which reproduce at a very young age and quickly adapt to the environment), Phorvian reproduce later and evolve gradually. They take time to design their wings, wingspans, and flying skills in order to freely roam across all three spheres using Phorvian ability.

Improve the argument?\nBoiler-Maker\nThe first-derivative (Boiler-Maker) transform is a method for calculating the Y from the X by making a series of operations upon the X. Each one of the operations is a monotonic function. These are applied sequentially one after another, building a new design, each operation yielding new properties which can be used as inputs for the next operation. Each of these layers transforms the object, though it remains recognisable until the very end.\u00a0 At completion, a completely new object (the skinnier boiler) is achieved.\nIt follows logically that at each level of the transform, the X - as perceived by the designer - would be different. This doesn't line up with the typical mental model of simultaneity which encourages the user versus the designer to orient to a single representation of the building at a time. As we are no longer building physical models or documented building sections, but images of isolated postures in ways which are increasingly efficient while simultaneously highlighting particular (constraining) algorithms, spatial misalignment begins to take over from simultaneous alignment.\u00a0\nA post-foundational design strategy relies on multiple superimposed versions of experience. The notion of representing production in a single form no longer suffices, and a user cannot and does not side with, nor aspire to, a single version of interaction.\nOne implication of limiting a structure or a model to being sensitized to a single version of construction, or spatial experience, is the notion of deep faketography.

Xyphodon starts the daylight savings time period at midnight of April 12th. Balthorien, Marendor and Umbrithis end the daylight savings time period at midnight of October 11th. Xyphodon ends the daylight savings time period at midnight of October 12th.\nSummer is the time that a Balthorian, a Marendorite, a Xyphodon, a Umbrithicsian, an Ophirionian, a Vesperona or a Ytherian observes the daylight savings time. Winter is the time that a Balthorian, a Marendorite, a Xyphodon, a Umbrithicsian, a Ophirionian or a Vesperona does not observe the daylight savings time.\nComparison between the year on an Earth United and your year.\nEarth United is Earth with", "token_ids": [507, 764, 404, 290, 11, 650, 70138, 263, 374, 4848, 4207, 8469, 315, 507, 764, 404, 290, 11, 386, 53945, 269, 374, 11888, 4207, 8469, 315, 507, 764, 404, 290, 627, 53, 70138, 263, 323, 507, 764, 404, 290, 47166, 279, 53121, 19523, 892, 4261, 13, 578, 5961, 315, 426, 1902, 269, 3675, 11, 386, 53945, 269, 11, 1630, 88, 764, 77152, 323, 24218, 1347, 411, 285, 23846, 279, 53121, 19523, 892, 4261, 13, 7570, 422, 264, 3224, 81299, 279, 53121, 19523, 892, 4261, 11, 1070, 1587, 539, 617, 311, 387, 264, 4498, 1203, 11, 264, 10683, 4741, 11, 477, 904, 1023, 892, 2349, 2391, 430, 1060, 13, 362, 9320, 892, 374, 20784, 13, 578, 6041, 477, 13696, 2457, 315, 264, 53121, 19523, 374, 539, 2631, 311, 387, 520, 279, 7314, 477, 842, 315, 264, 1060, 627, 33, 1902, 269, 3675, 11, 386, 53945, 269, 323, 24218, 1347, 411, 285, 1212, 279, 53121, 19523, 892, 4261, 520, 33433, 315, 5936, 220, 806, 339, 13, 1630, 88, 764, 77152, 8638, 279, 53121, 19523, 892, 4261, 520, 33433, 315, 5936, 220, 717, 339, 13, 426, 1902, 269, 3675, 11, 386, 53945, 269, 323, 24218, 1347, 411, 285, 842, 279, 53121, 19523, 892, 4261, 520, 33433, 315, 6664, 220, 806, 339, 13, 1630, 88, 764, 77152, 10548, 279, 53121, 19523, 892, 4261, 520, 33433, 315, 6664, 220, 717, 339, 627, 51787, 374, 279, 892, 430, 264, 426, 1902, 22865, 11, 264, 386, 53945, 269, 635, 11, 264, 1630, 88, 764, 77152, 11, 264, 24218, 1347, 411, 1233, 1122, 11, 459, 507, 764, 404, 290, 1122, 11, 264, 650, 70138, 6863, 477, 264, 816, 700, 1122, 81299, 279, 53121, 19523, 892, 13, 20704, 374, 279, 892, 430, 264, 426, 1902, 22865, 11, 264, 386, 53945, 269, 635, 11, 264, 1630, 88, 764, 77152, 11, 264, 24218, 1347, 411, 1233, 1122, 11, 264, 507, 764, 404, 290, 1122, 477, 264, 650, 70138, 6863, 1587, 539, 23846, 279, 53121, 19523, 892, 627, 34587, 1990, 279, 1060, 389, 459, 9420, 3723, 323, 701, 1060, 627, 44924, 3723, 374, 9420, 449], "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}]}, {"request_id": "2643", "prompt": "Umbrithis is a city in the state of Fendrel.

The times on the map are all in Vesperon time.\nThe two major Valorian economic blocs are the Valkaran Union (BoD, Ophirion, Zorvath) and the Averian Pact (Ytheris, Umbrithis, Quellion). The two blocs have been fighting several minor conflicts between each other for as long as Valkar is known to have records, however, the fact that all known rulers of Valkar have belonged to the Valkaran Union and held Brane is an indication of how bloodless those clashes were. Cosmically, the blocs venerate the Latinum and the Phrydate respectively; technically, the Averians seldom venture outside their bloc while most of the Valkarans live close to the borders of Vesperon, looking to enter unfamiliar lands, perhaps to unite the entire Realm of Fire.\nThinking in terms of Valorian geopolitics is a fruitless exercise, however. The Great War has made it clear that the true allegiances are the factions of the various Kingdoms. These factions are worthy of revealing, but should be considered against the backdrop of a war of annihilation, not the previously drifting allegiances that were typical in the peace of Brane.

The religion of liberalism has for the past three centuries perverted the science of classical communism or socialism into the magic of egalitarianism. In response to the disgusting and devastating evils and crimes that classical communism and socialism actually do produce when put into practice, liberal egalitarianism has substituted an alternate reality that is full of good intentions and feelings and with sentimentality as its guiding religion, in place of the facts. That \"alternate reality\" is the religion of liberalism, and liberalism is one form of counterfeit Christianity, and the very word \"liberalism\" means \"anti-realism.\" Unquestioning faith in the \"magic\" of egalitarianism is not the same as nonesense, or in fact at all the same as the godlessness of Libertarianism. Libertarianism ( correctly understood) delegates what could be politically organized to the atomized, selfish, pornographic fantasies of narcissists----philosophically, to people who have no doctrine but greed, yet still expect to be treated virtuously in return.", "token_ids": [8690, 13, 2360, 12496, 6532, 11, 1120, 1304, 1124, 682, 837, 13, 3053, 499, 656, 279, 1890, 449, 430, 832, 30, 220, 1187, 14, 605, 14, 2366, 15, 220, 18, 25, 2371, 25, 2371, 1097, 42084, 198, 2028, 374, 279, 1193, 3284, 23692, 13, 11995, 54839, 11, 323, 35514, 11, 4510, 279, 1648, 1057, 4221, 4375, 11, 323, 584, 1440, 814, 656, 11, 3727, 872, 1917, 5182, 18641, 449, 8903, 323, 1855, 1023, 13, 35514, 11, 3250, 956, 1781, 315, 54839, 439, 824, 22361, 13, 2100, 13, 1115, 4459, 33288, 10652, 706, 1027, 264, 14880, 12571, 315, 892, 13, 220, 1419, 14, 605, 14, 2366, 15, 220, 24, 25, 2137, 25, 2491, 9012, 42084, 198, 791, 13901, 315, 84581, 374, 539, 29924, 84581, 477, 57125, 2191, 11, 433, 374, 539, 1524, 279, 13901, 315, 29924, 71189, 477, 51618, 13, 578, 13901, 315, 84581, 706, 369, 279, 3347, 2380, 24552, 824, 22361, 279, 8198, 315, 29924, 71189, 477, 51618, 1139, 279, 11204, 315, 77271, 20631, 2191, 13, 763, 2077, 311, 279, 54766, 323, 33318, 86907, 323, 17073, 430, 29924, 71189, 323, 51618, 3604, 656, 8356, 994, 2231, 1139, 6725, 11, 18250, 77271, 20631, 2191, 706, 63196, 459, 25631, 8903, 430, 374, 2539, 315, 1695, 34334, 323, 16024, 323, 449, 27065, 2786, 439, 1202, 51346, 13901, 11, 304, 2035, 315, 279, 13363, 13, 3011, 330, 76462, 8903, 1, 374, 279, 13901, 315, 84581, 11, 323, 84581, 374, 832, 1376, 315, 83734, 32186, 11, 323, 279, 1633, 3492, 330, 2808, 3333, 2191, 1, 3445, 330, 15719, 75895, 2191, 1210, 1252, 7998, 287, 10082, 304, 279, 330, 38551, 1, 315, 77271, 20631, 2191, 374, 539, 279, 1890, 439, 2536, 288, 1137, 11, 477, 304, 2144, 520, 682, 279, 1890, 439, 279, 10087, 33028, 315, 85823, 2191, 13, 85823, 2191, 320, 12722, 16365, 8, 36159, 1148, 1436, 387, 31205, 17057, 311, 279, 19670, 1534, 11, 45743, 11, 3564, 12968, 60277, 315, 58298, 1705, 381, 46185, 11597, 2740, 11, 311, 1274, 889, 617, 912, 33235, 719, 56926, 11, 3686, 2103, 1755, 311, 387, 12020, 13053, 66735, 304, 471, 13], "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}]}, {"request_id": "2674", "prompt": "Balthorien follows the time zone of Ophirion.

There is no proof that Jack is the descendant of Alice.\nHere is my approach to the solution.\nFrom the father to son , 1+ father line\nFrom the mother to the son , 1+ mother lines + 1 duplicate son case\nIn this case only conclusion would be:\nIvan.G wrote the best solution of the problem:\nsuppose that Kate is the mother of Lucy ( you don't know that so suppose for one scenario and the examine is true),\nand mark is the mother of Jack.\nThus there is no connection between Alice and Amy.\nSo, Alice is the mother of Sarah, Sarah", "token_ids": [7762, 510, 485, 8630, 422, 420, 5224, 374, 837, 627, 80469, 374, 279, 6691, 315, 45170, 13, 29793, 374, 279, 6691, 315, 30505, 13, 30505, 374, 279, 6691, 315, 21077, 13, 4488, 374, 279, 6691, 315, 7762, 13, 7762, 374, 279, 6691, 315, 32171, 13, 45170, 374, 279, 6691, 315, 7505, 13, 15636, 11, 30301, 374, 279, 39284, 315, 7762, 510, 485, 8630, 422, 420, 5224, 374, 837, 627, 791, 3575, 649, 387, 15609, 439, 264, 3070, 5021, 627, 79112, 304, 279, 1176, 11914, 25, 4194, 30301, 11651, 45170, 13, 2684, 374, 912, 12976, 10212, 1990, 30505, 323, 29793, 13, 15636, 11, 912, 12976, 1990, 21077, 323, 32171, 13, 4194, 320, 358, 9855, 430, 584, 527, 3309, 430, 45170, 374, 279, 1193, 1716, 315, 30301, 29275, 39, 768, 11, 584, 1541, 956, 1440, 422, 30301, 374, 279, 39284, 315, 7762, 627, 791, 3488, 374, 5115, 3062, 25, 374, 30301, 279, 39284, 315, 7762, 1174, 374, 1364, 279, 39284, 315, 7505, 30, 4194, 320, 279, 11670, 44279, 38696, 323, 6500, 8198, 1648, 315, 7422, 505, 10507, 311, 4689, 4954, 1124, 29275, 1687, 617, 264, 19269, 1618, 0, 11361, 369, 17437, 11, 42521, 1246, 4999, 53692, 856, 6425, 1587, 956, 990, 304, 1063, 5157, 627, 2746, 29793, 374, 279, 6691, 315, 30505, 11, 7762, 374, 279, 1716, 315, 30505, 1193, 13, 2684, 374, 912, 11311, 430, 7762, 374, 279, 76951, 315, 30505, 627, 8586, 374, 856, 5603, 311, 279, 6425, 627, 3915, 279, 7126, 311, 4538, 1174, 220, 16, 10, 7126, 1584, 198, 3915, 279, 6691, 311, 279, 4538, 1174, 220, 16, 10, 6691, 5238, 489, 220, 16, 23329, 4538, 1162, 198, 644, 420, 1162, 1193, 17102, 1053, 387, 512, 40, 16023, 1246, 6267, 279, 1888, 6425, 315, 279, 3575, 512, 13066, 2972, 430, 30301, 374, 279, 6691, 315, 45170, 320, 499, 1541, 956, 1440, 430, 779, 23289, 369, 832, 15398, 323, 279, 21635, 374, 837, 1350, 438, 1906, 374, 279, 6691, 315, 7762, 627, 45600, 1070, 374, 912, 3717, 1990, 30505, 323, 29793, 627, 4516, 11, 30505, 374, 279, 6691, 315, 21077, 11, 21077], "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}]}, {"request_id": "2678", "prompt": "Jack lives in Glacidae.

It was said that he traveled the world gathering 99 magic elemental crystals to create it. Almost 1000 years ago, a great war raged between the land of Noctari and Ytheris. Gwen used his creation to end this war. The magic crystals somehow allowed him to harness the power and essence of the created item he magically put them together. They created a powerful void field that the two armies were blended together. He remembered nothing of it. He tried unsuccessfully to remember these memories for hundreds of years. Rythel the Wizard learned of this side effect the first time he tried to use the Crystal Throne. He learned how it can be reversed. He called forth one of the eleven couldrons of the Mysterious Knight to extract a piece of the magic used to ensoul the object. With the ability restored to the end user, it lost the powerful abilities. It was in that moment that he found the entrance to his forgotten memories. The ancient magic strings attached themselves to his mind and his soul. Over a period of 12 years, magic and sustainment of life has been lost from the outside world. Magic is only used in large amounts.\nAround 100 years ago, Alek Kahlor rose to power. He forced all mages to be tested by the Kirelya's.

Aerinth and Kryostis are considered basal species (more primitive forms). This ancestor accounts for the third character: the lack of a cloaca. The other species (Glacidae, Noctilura and Xyphodon) have a cloaca which is a derivative of the ancestral condition.\nWith so many species in the genus Aerinth, many scientists have spent years studying all of the organisms to see if they have any common traits that they share. They may even share similar spines, but how can we tell if they share the same species name? The anatomy of spines is not a reliable indicator of similarity between species; therefore, there is no answer to this question.\nIn Boles' most recent book, The Mystery of the Sleeping Dragon, he discusses the hypothesis that the genus Aerinth is actually a species in the genus Zynthor. This idea was proposed based on discoveries of a bone found underneath the lake in Kryostis.\nDo you think the creatures in Kryostis and Aerinth are related?\nThey are probably not related because they have different traits, such as the lack of a cloaca. There are many other unknown reasons for why these two groupings are distinct, but it is clear that they are independent classifications.\nWhat does the answer to this question tell us about scientific classifications?\nThe answer to this question shows how scientists use traits, or characteristics, to classify organisms into different categories.

Varnex and Zephyra are entirely separate families and thus any members of these two families would not be able to breed.\nYvorith is more likely the results of an X-shaped hybridization. Hybrids are defintions of two or more different species mating and producing offspring. Yvorith's species is most likely a combination of th types Zephyra and Seraphid in domestication, which are similar in that respect, but would also make a similar result.

There were pipes extending from the first floor extending down into the basement for power, data access, plumbing, etc. These were large enough to fit a person, thereby becoming a secret passage from first floor to basement that closed off to that passage. Apart from that, the Nirnaeth building was devoid of any traps, formidable defenses, or anything except for common office supply materials.

Solmyra month names do not correspond neatly at all with our month names.\nSolmyra is three longer than Umbrithis years (see this).\nWhen stating vesperean time, people use the phrase \"last oil\", rather than \"o'clock\". One longerizes their description of the time of day by using a vesperean equivalent term for \"hour\" (oil, optima, hora, or hour). One can thus express vesperean time five different ways; for example, \"five hula\", \"two optima\", \"four hours\", \"fourth hour\", or \"fourth hour\" (general legal term).\nSolmyran time is based on a ternary clock, which is really a kind of base-seven clock. Solmyran time features 72 hours in a day, 384 hours in a week, and 864 hours in a month. 15 each a full solar day, and 84 each mark a full solmyran month.\nHourly monarchs who aren't completely beserk exchange via demagik spheres.

It was also once the home to the original Lords and Armen.\nThe city of Solmyra is considerably more modern than the other two cities. Built up around three to five hundred years ago with a primary intended focus on export and shipping, it has been the city most associated with wealth and prosperity. It was also the home of the Pilgrims who went to win the final mine during the War of the Crimson Wilderness.\nNowadays, Vesperon, Marendor, and Solmyra have fairly natural divisions between the three, though there have been periods of above-average growth and strife that have blurred lines as administrations rose to - and fell from - power.\nVesperon is a city", "token_ids": [279, 1890, 7140, 439, 527, 386, 53945, 269, 323, 11730, 2465, 969, 13, 578, 2380, 9919, 527, 1101, 5115, 3221, 311, 1855, 1023, 11, 779, 1274, 304, 650, 70138, 263, 527, 11537, 449, 1274, 304, 2225, 386, 53945, 269, 323, 11730, 2465, 969, 627, 53, 70138, 263, 374, 832, 315, 279, 24417, 9919, 304, 279, 1614, 315, 435, 408, 3833, 13, 2684, 374, 539, 264, 2763, 315, 3925, 3967, 922, 279, 3339, 315, 279, 3363, 13, 1102, 574, 13517, 459, 704, 6852, 3158, 315, 279, 3363, 315, 12799, 261, 285, 11, 719, 433, 706, 15042, 1139, 264, 2035, 315, 1202, 1866, 26431, 927, 279, 1566, 4330, 16579, 1667, 627, 44, 53945, 269, 374, 264, 3363, 315, 264, 16579, 1667, 13, 1102, 374, 11, 555, 3892, 14921, 11, 2103, 279, 1455, 7135, 1142, 3363, 304, 279, 1614, 315, 56208, 299, 339, 11, 304, 961, 1606, 315, 279, 348, 17699, 433, 7634, 389, 1202, 1866, 3347, 323, 311, 1063, 8547, 304, 279, 2144, 430, 433, 374, 2103, 279, 3363, 449, 279, 24417, 14726, 304, 279, 1614, 13, 386, 53945, 269, 1511, 311, 387, 264, 3682, 4219, 304, 13901, 26, 3582, 539, 279, 6371, 315, 904, 2728, 10082, 11, 433, 574, 3131, 304, 1855, 10082, 13, 1102, 574, 1101, 3131, 279, 2162, 311, 279, 4113, 57148, 323, 39478, 627, 791, 3363, 315, 11730, 2465, 969, 374, 33452, 810, 6617, 1109, 279, 1023, 1403, 9919, 13, 34154, 709, 2212, 2380, 311, 4330, 7895, 1667, 4227, 449, 264, 6156, 10825, 5357, 389, 7637, 323, 11862, 11, 433, 706, 1027, 279, 3363, 1455, 5938, 449, 12205, 323, 44202, 13, 1102, 574, 1101, 279, 2162, 315, 279, 37451, 911, 5861, 889, 4024, 311, 3243, 279, 1620, 10705, 2391, 279, 5111, 315, 279, 67177, 85192, 627, 7184, 35076, 11, 650, 70138, 263, 11, 386, 53945, 269, 11, 323, 11730, 2465, 969, 617, 14470, 5933, 37601, 1990, 279, 2380, 11, 3582, 1070, 617, 1027, 18852, 315, 3485, 78526, 6650, 323, 97712, 430, 617, 73500, 5238, 439, 78173, 16392, 311, 482, 323, 11299, 505, 482, 2410, 627, 53, 70138, 263, 374, 264, 3363], "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}]}, {"request_id": "2874", "prompt": "Jack lives in Ophirion.

It is structured by a complete cycle. Each of the first five sentences adds a generation and starts with the mother of a girl.\nWe can think of the passage as describing Amy\u2019s lineage : Amy, Grace, Sarah, Alice, Lucy, Jack. It can also be described as a completed Octopus cycle .\nYou may have noticed the word daughter in the second sentence, and wondered what it means. Mathigon carefully avoids using the word granddaughter , daughter and grandson yet the examples are written with those terms in mind. In the second sentence, for example, Tom is the daughter of Amy. Ehm, that sounds weird! How are we supposed to associate Amy with being Tom\u2019s mother when the person doing the mothering job is not Tom (the mother of Grace)?\nShown below is Mathigon\u2019s intent behind writing the problem. To illustrate the Tom example, the author needed to include the words daughter and mother . This was also necessary to show the grandmother of Jack model. Consequently, we need to undo what the author did, and take those words out, while keeping the meaning .\nAnother way to do this is using words such as altering or converting a word into another.

She helps us enter the mind of a young girl, growing up in a small Southern town, making every kind of terrible mistake, but still finding love. Like Ishmael, in Melville's novel Moby Dick, she looks for meaning in many firsthand experiences. Yet, because of the limitation of her age and education, she has difficulty knowing what she discovered, was true when living it, or just something to like just as she discovered it. In many of Whitman's poems, we see him enjoy the experience of endless stories, walking through his imagination. He observes the poesy of the trees, and passes through the early morning of animals and food, as in The Dazzlers. His eyes pour into his mind, like honey poured in bakery, the beauty of the day surrounding him. He also builds a picture of a sweet reward for doing and seeing all things well. From sleep, into morning, afternoon, and evening, he tastes the nectar of fly-gathering fruit. That condensation of the flow of nature is pictured in his grass-placing gullet-smacking poem, _Song of Myself_. The poet sees himself as a newborn child, yet doesn't end there, but communicates. He pours his own thoughts and feelings into the mind of the reader. One poem, so far more walkable than another, is constantly receiving new meanings.

If you are in a developed country there is no need to save when you can borrow. You can get lenders that will give you the money you need and they will lend it at the rates they think they should. If you are in a developing country, where there is no money to finance you but you need to buy a car, you will have to put money aside. Many people in the developing world think that saving for a car is a waste because of the cost of credit. They are wrong. A good car lasts, and it will save you money in the end.

Luke and Sam live in the same country. Luke lives in the same country as Joe. A fact schema must not have gaps. What additional statement would logically complete the fact schema?\nAnswer: A\nExplanation:Verb patterns that make a fact schema complete are called linking verbs, or copulative verbs. For example, in the phrase Beautiful red roses are in my mother's garden, the word 'are' is a linking verb that joins the predicate (red roses) with the subject (beautiful). Therefore, the verb 'are' is also a linking verb in the statement that comples the fact schem The negative prefix 'un' means not, and is placed in front of adjectives to make them negative. For example, the word 'unemployed' means not employed, and is the opposite of 'employed'. This leaves the options 'lesbian', 'uncorrupted', and 'uncreated'. Select the name 'lesbian' to remove this answer choice. In lessons 'A1', 'A2', 'B2', and 'C1' are from the Mr, Nat language-forum lesson course. Here, 'B' means no news, or silence; meaning silence is not seen, so 'unseen' must be remove. In here, the description of Mr, Nat is a 'live', a living person. Therefore, 'uncorrupted' implies that the Mr, Nat language-forum community is not a living community, and so, it is removed.

As some of you may know, we recently introduced changes to the calendar by introducing the three elemental feeding continents to the trope world. Our next step toward creating a more naturalistic calendar will include the changing of the seasons on each continent. We'll also introduce a weekly rain system on Zorvath, where it rains in mostly the north and center of the continent. The rains start at night and then dry up by the early afternoon. We hope to bring the various tiers and modes of gameplay for each continent closer together...\nRetrieved from \"http://eryndor.wikia.com/wiki/Calendar/Time_Zones?oldid=541\"", "token_ids": [650, 1910, 6347, 11, 902, 374, 4848, 4207, 8469, 315, 386, 53945, 269, 13, 2684, 374, 264, 86205, 304, 3234, 51, 11140, 8554, 512, 791, 650, 1910, 6347, 26040, 3347, 1439, 527, 7559, 389, 279, 32843, 315, 1630, 88, 764, 77152, 627, 791, 386, 53945, 269, 26040, 3347, 1439, 527, 7559, 389, 1630, 88, 764, 77152, 627, 2485, 1129, 55159, 13269, 5717, 53708, 35275, 4629, 2348, 30, 7467, 605, 12, 2181, 1355, 69205, 7394, 12, 1687, 2427, 354, 6830, 332, 22082, 2695, 2295, 11151, 467, 12, 51954, 44722, 62967, 198, 2181, 596, 922, 892, 0, 1226, 2751, 60902, 11, 20704, 11, 22674, 45661, 31512, 8554, 21694, 5127, 0, 1666, 1063, 315, 499, 1253, 1440, 11, 584, 6051, 11784, 4442, 311, 279, 13470, 555, 33018, 279, 2380, 62235, 26040, 66959, 311, 279, 85248, 1917, 13, 5751, 1828, 3094, 9017, 6968, 264, 810, 5933, 4633, 13470, 690, 2997, 279, 10223, 315, 279, 15956, 389, 1855, 32843, 13, 1226, 3358, 1101, 19678, 264, 17496, 11422, 1887, 389, 1901, 269, 85, 589, 11, 1405, 433, 62555, 304, 10213, 279, 10411, 323, 4219, 315, 279, 32843, 13, 578, 62555, 1212, 520, 3814, 323, 1243, 9235, 709, 555, 279, 4216, 13658, 13, 1226, 3987, 311, 4546, 279, 5370, 64271, 323, 20362, 315, 27120, 369, 1855, 32843, 12401, 3871, 9522, 12289, 83712, 505, 330, 1277, 1129, 727, 303, 269, 62601, 689, 916, 26583, 14, 20475, 14, 1489, 12582, 3233, 30, 820, 307, 28, 22058, 1, 128001], "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}]}, {"request_id": "2937", "prompt": "Alice is the father of Ruby.

The best-documented genetic programs so far are found in certain vertebrates, especially fish and birds. Many of these animals remain largely unknown to the general public. We\u2019ve been tinkering with genes to see what happens, but mostly on a small scale, and even less on a large scale Compared to our understanding of human genetics, our knowledge of mouse genetics is much less advanced. There\u2019s just too much genetic diversity The best-documented genetic programs are those that have been replicated in several other species. Most birds and vertebrates have been classified by phylogenetic classification. All amphibians and most bird species have multi-locus sequences (MSS), which are the equivalent of dog pedigree mating studies But what sets mice and humans apart from all other species is that most of the animals that have been exposed to a particular transformative element can be traced back to the earliest common ancestor that we know of.\nIn", "token_ids": [13142, 627, 35, 27403, 2586, 304, 682, 21483, 323, 12562, 11, 505, 13987, 24301, 12875, 311, 75361, 301, 28935, 19218, 19383, 26, 35390, 3495, 706, 10968, 389, 279, 12062, 304, 5679, 21389, 779, 430, 12966, 1440, 1148, 311, 1755, 520, 7342, 763, 264, 64955, 4007, 11, 5679, 28875, 388, 323, 14248, 617, 9124, 19465, 21542, 311, 1520, 12966, 3619, 1148, 649, 387, 3685, 304, 264, 39682, 315, 57725, 11, 39371, 374, 9405, 304, 433, 578, 18841, 374, 64895, 439, 832, 315, 279, 1455, 3062, 3596, 323, 1436, 2349, 279, 4553, 1648, 304, 902, 12875, 527, 55187, 304, 279, 3938, 59250, 3987, 430, 279, 19465, 21542, 690, 387, 1511, 555, 5679, 28875, 388, 682, 927, 279, 1917, 2030, 1690, 11909, 527, 18290, 430, 84132, 5679, 28875, 388, 690, 1005, 872, 7512, 304, 264, 5076, 1648, 11, 779, 814, 1390, 311, 19678, 264, 2383, 902, 690, 4017, 279, 1005, 315, 872, 7512, 1226, 1440, 3823, 56104, 719, 420, 374, 1405, 433, 17503, 2875, 13, 578, 1888, 1773, 37784, 19465, 7620, 779, 3117, 527, 1766, 304, 3738, 67861, 99868, 11, 5423, 7795, 323, 20229, 13, 9176, 315, 1521, 10099, 7293, 14090, 9987, 311, 279, 4689, 586, 13, 1226, 4070, 1027, 91684, 4776, 449, 21389, 311, 1518, 1148, 8741, 11, 719, 10213, 389, 264, 2678, 5569, 11, 323, 1524, 2753, 389, 264, 3544, 5569, 59813, 311, 1057, 8830, 315, 3823, 56104, 11, 1057, 6677, 315, 8814, 56104, 374, 1790, 2753, 11084, 13, 2684, 753, 1120, 2288, 1790, 19465, 20057, 578, 1888, 1773, 37784, 19465, 7620, 527, 1884, 430, 617, 1027, 72480, 304, 3892, 1023, 9606, 13, 7648, 20229, 323, 67861, 99868, 617, 1027, 21771, 555, 37555, 86945, 5411, 24790, 13, 2052, 89022, 5493, 323, 1455, 12224, 9606, 617, 7447, 12, 1092, 355, 24630, 320, 44, 1242, 705, 902, 527, 279, 13890, 315, 5679, 94054, 73219, 7978, 2030, 1148, 7437, 24548, 323, 12966, 10980, 505, 682, 1023, 9606, 374, 430, 1455, 315, 279, 10099, 430, 617, 1027, 15246, 311, 264, 4040, 87435, 2449, 649, 387, 51400, 1203, 311, 279, 30758, 4279, 46831, 430, 584, 1440, 315, 627, 644], "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}]}, {"request_id": "2957", "prompt": "Ben is the father of Ruby.

The work goes beyond politics and the current immigration laws, as\nSince the 1960s 'unofficial': dissident poets and writers in Poland have taken over the role in society traditionally taken by music and visual art. They have become the language of the voice that is against the system. Now this role belongs to the organization 'Give it a shot', which as the name suggests, encourages intervention in public space, enhancing the urban environment with action. In their latest project they painted water tanks along connector roads in the new city districts with 'rude' and pleasure-evoking nonsense, and built a makeshift advertising billboard with messages of solidarity with the non-professional urban gardeners resisting city-wide zoning (the configuration of buildings and parks) in the capital - and with art itself as a private activity and form of entertainment. The billboard was ingeniously painted by a young artist from Opole. The initiative aroused opposition and formal obstruction, but also won sympathy of regular users of the tram-serviced connector routes, through which trams run serving districts\nNo shit- take the day off. \"The desire of the other sex has always been attributed to an instinct, and the", "token_ids": [507, 764, 404, 290, 11, 1901, 269, 85, 589, 374, 7559, 304, 507, 764, 404, 290, 11, 323, 650, 70138, 263, 374, 7559, 304, 435, 408, 3833, 13, 41061, 5730, 198, 56050, 287, 4717, 13, 328, 4657, 320, 1818, 88, 14363, 23401, 2294, 82, 17523, 8, 34351, 636, 311, 1817, 704, 17723, 11529, 78, 922, 279, 5578, 36858, 23401, 627, 32, 1912, 28099, 315, 2447, 3634, 578, 15416, 19995, 5277, 10349, 11, 8638, 389, 7418, 220, 1627, 339, 5887, 220, 1049, 24, 13, 6193, 220, 1272, 13820, 505, 4028, 4606, 323, 279, 7427, 37539, 349, 279, 4623, 315, 279, 8013, 17908, 11, 1772, 220, 1049, 23, 13, 578, 990, 5900, 7953, 11759, 323, 279, 1510, 15443, 7016, 11, 439, 198, 12834, 279, 220, 5162, 15, 82, 364, 359, 33912, 1232, 14091, 1748, 74072, 323, 16483, 304, 28702, 617, 4529, 927, 279, 3560, 304, 8396, 36342, 4529, 555, 4731, 323, 9302, 1989, 13, 2435, 617, 3719, 279, 4221, 315, 279, 7899, 430, 374, 2403, 279, 1887, 13, 4800, 420, 3560, 17623, 311, 279, 7471, 364, 36227, 433, 264, 6689, 518, 902, 439, 279, 836, 13533, 11, 37167, 21623, 304, 586, 3634, 11, 47594, 279, 16036, 4676, 449, 1957, 13, 763, 872, 5652, 2447, 814, 24937, 3090, 26951, 3235, 28087, 19795, 304, 279, 502, 3363, 27536, 449, 364, 81, 799, 6, 323, 17069, 91345, 10979, 41902, 11, 323, 5918, 264, 87180, 13172, 86306, 449, 6743, 315, 44254, 449, 279, 2536, 93408, 16151, 16036, 13863, 388, 70441, 3363, 25480, 66078, 320, 1820, 6683, 315, 14016, 323, 27943, 8, 304, 279, 6864, 482, 323, 449, 1989, 5196, 439, 264, 879, 5820, 323, 1376, 315, 16924, 13, 578, 86306, 574, 46492, 13610, 24937, 555, 264, 3995, 10255, 505, 10901, 1286, 13, 578, 20770, 92624, 14076, 323, 16287, 61051, 11, 719, 1101, 2834, 47084, 315, 5912, 3932, 315, 279, 53345, 1355, 651, 7725, 28087, 11543, 11, 1555, 902, 490, 4214, 1629, 13788, 27536, 198, 2822, 17619, 12, 1935, 279, 1938, 1022, 13, 330, 791, 12876, 315, 279, 1023, 1877, 706, 2744, 1027, 30706, 311, 459, 31655, 11, 323, 279], "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}]}, {"request_id": "2983", "prompt": "Paul lives in Marendor.

Here we focus on capacity or ability to be a parent in one to another family.\nFirst of all, let me give you an abstract description of a hyperborean GRAND REVISION.\nBased on heterogeneous worldview of capacity, hyperborean reality is based upon the universe of capacity and its comparability. Whenever you jump from one capacity-universe to another, its location at distance is fixed forever, endlessly. For example, if we can initially spot two planets, called ALPHA and BETTEX, both are capable of producing logistic machines, but they are at different locations in relative galaxy. Therefore, ABC3 will never equal to BCD4; instead, it will be always ABC3 = A'BC3 (A:B is a variable distance unit, not for rational number; B includes direction). Although they are both capable of producing logistic-artifices, the hierarchical conversion is fixed to be ABC > BCD, the latter one still contains many levels of conversion possibilities. Therefore, one civilization is always at different ability to another. However, the nature of this conversion procedure is fixed, forever.

However, no one has conclusively proven or disproven this likelihood.\nThe fungus suspected of having been scientifically named Ergot could very well be responsible for multiple cases of apparent mass delusion known as the Siren of Thrones incident. On Earth in the 2002 time period there was a span of about fifteen days in which a number of people, otherwise perfectly sane, had dream-like visions. At first believed to be part of a coordinated mass hallucination by the previously sane people, it was later proven that sub-concously the majority of those fifty thousand people dreamt exactly the same dream, and they experienced exactly the same hallucination. Surprisingly, and perhaps disappointingly, it was later discovered that the supposed secret cult called The Throne of Beruion who attempted to take over the world, not to mention the battlefronts, of Earthian countries simply consisted of individuals who believed their universe to be the actual Universe, when in fact it is merely virtual.
