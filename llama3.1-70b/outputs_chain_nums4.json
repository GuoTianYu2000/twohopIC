To form a community, first the player to the right of the dealer reveals his or her card and places it next to the discard pile to form the beginning of the new community. The dealer then takes a turn, and so on.\nThe player that makes the start can then endeavour to launch a new expedition or place an expedition already started. Planting flags From the beginning of the game, you have unblocked the possibility of placing a flag on one of the expeditions.\nMake a step, plant a flag then make another step with an expedition started by another player than yourself and plant a flag. You can stop as often as you want to plant a flag. Moving both cubes in the same round prevents grouping the points at the end of the game. Each step costs an amount of coins corresponding to the sum of the values of the expeditions you have chosen.\nChoosing Direction To choose the direction, the player is going to use the route cards they have in their hands. The total length of these legs must be less than four. The route cards can be reintroduced in the game thanks to different actions available to the players at the same time as they play area. A card you keep in your hand is played at the end of the game to reduce the length of a leg and avoid paying money.\nShould you own at least one flag on a leg of the expedition you unblock, you will get paid; if you do not own a flag, you will have to pay the same amount. At the end of the game, each player keeps just two flags on each leg. According to these two last flags, the player gets paid again twice the length of the leg for each flag. The other flags are removed from the leg. You can find a PDF version here. The rulebook is full of them. Quick-playing game based on action-selection.

From the above table, it is evident that the genus Noctilura is classified under the family Chrysalix, while the genus Phorvian is classified under the family Seraphid. This means that if one species is included in a particular genus, then that species is also included in the family under which that genus is classified.

But we need a real commitment to the power of the love of Jesus Christ, the power of the Gospel and the power of a relationship with God and each other for the gospel to reach its potential,\u201d said the head of the SCLC, the Rev. Alvin R. Winford.\nHe noted that despite the fact that the church \u201chas tried to be a moral voice\u201d during a time when immigration was historically high, \u201cwe are not allowed to morally correct the actions of the bad guys. We are not allowed to let people out of jail before they are sentenced and we have to obey the law because if not we will lose our church.

What I have come to believe the final paragraph of the online tutorial should say is that qualitative identity is not a strict identity like numerical identity and so is not a substitute for numerical identity.\nI therefore am in agreement that the true definition of a quantitative identity is equivalent with the definition of numerical identity.\nSo any comment that asserts that the divine essence is the same as the persons must acknowledge that any number of other alternatives also hold equally true; therefore the above commentary is no proof of anything, it is merely an observation that identifies one possibility from among a multitude of possibilities.\nWhen you know the essence of something, you know something about the nature of that thing which cannot be communicated without losing an identity of meaning.\nIf the divine essence is three and the persons are three then how is that different than saying the divine essence is four and the persons are three or four or one?\nThe first conclusion is physical, it can be seen and understood in the physical world.

First, we are told that Noctilura belongs to the genus Uthrelin. The genus Uthrelin belongs to the family Yvorith. This information tells us that Noctilura is a species that belongs to the genus Uthrelin and is classified under the family Yvorith. The next piece of information we have is that Xyphodon belongs to the genus Dranthidae, which belongs to the family Thalorium. This information is not directly relevant to the conclusion we are trying to draw, but it does provide additional information about the hierarchy of genera and families. Next, we are told that Seraphid belongs to the genus Kryostis, which belongs to the family Gryvus. This piece of information is significant because it provides us with an additional family that is related to the genus Kryostis. Finally, we are told that Eldrinth belongs to the genus Phorvian, which belongs to the family Zephyra. Once again, this information does not directly relate to our conclusion, but it does provide additional context for the hierarchy of genera and families. Based on the information provided, we can conclude that Noctilura is indeed classified under the family Gryvus. This conclusion is based on the fact that the genus Uthrelin, to which Noctilura belongs, is a part of the family Yvorith. Additionally, we are told that the genus Kryostis, to which Seraphid belongs, is also a part of the family Gryvus.

Understand what information we are given and what question is being asked this will help us in solving the dilemma given in the question.\nComplete step by step answer: A Venn diagram is a diagram used in mathematics and logic to compare and contrast two or more concepts. It is named after John Venn, who introduced its bark with circles in 1880. In Venn Diagrams, two or three disparate elements can be represented in four circles within a rectangular border that represent the universal class, as shown here.\nIn the region or topic of Umbrithis there is 1 language which is Hindi. And in the other region Vynora there is again 1 language which is French. Again in third region Eryndor there is one language i.e. English. In last region named Quellion there is one laguage which is Italian.\nTherefore the region wise language in which they speak is shown below:\nAlex is a guy who lives in the region called Umbrithis. Umbrithis region people speak Hindi therefore we can tell Alex speaks hindi.\nAlice is a girl who lives in region known as Vynora. Vynora region people speak French therefore we can tell that alice speaks French.\nTom lives in a region known as Quellion.

Therefore, ferrus is a summer-blooming plant. <p><br /> Option <strong>(B)</strong> is correct. Plants do not rely on animals to move from place to place or hunt for food. As shown by the chart, plants do not have limbs. Plants take in carbon dioxide through their leaves, so they must be in contact with air. <br /> </p>\nThe life of a node consists of three major stages: the developing stage, the mature stage, and the senescing stage. In the developing stage, the new node grows and gains size. Proteins in the node's cells are broken down to provide resources for cell growth. Each cell divides, and new cells are made throughout the node. In the mature stage, all the cells of the node have ceased growth and division. The cells make new proteins, and some of these proteins are used to activate photosynthesis, a process that turns carbon dioxide from the air into sugar. In the senescing stage, the node produces special molecules that slowly break down the membrane of each cell. By the end of the senescing stage, almost all of the cells have lost their membranes and died. <p><br /> Proper beauty nodes are brought from the field to a grove, where they are planted with slower-growing flowers. While they develop, the nodes provide an aboveground plant body with attractive wrappings.

The digital audio files are available at: maciunas.bandcamp.com Releases under this name do not have artwork and the artist identity is unimportant. The recording itself is more vital than the fictional artist name. An experiment in making and releasing music without defined artificial categories, although the recording process still maintains autonomy, flexibility, and almost shapes itself. Collectively, recordings encapsulate a convincing and overwhelmingly sonic voice. Starting with a quick decision to adopt this process, recording began in July, shortly after the passing of my father. I developed a goal of trying to create sound which could reach my father through a portal into another dimension similar to Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke's portrayal of the fictional millennial hotel in the film, \"2001: A Space Odyssey.\" Kubrick had a fascinating ability to bring to life imaginary high concept art created by artists in the 1960s. Clarke created a literary culture inspiring science and wonder with his infinite imagination and visionary writing. Together, they can still haunt your soul with the trippy visuals, psychedelic colors, well composed frightening tone, space age psychoacoustics, and gorgeous ambient music soundtrack. Ironic that I was searching for a temporary souvenir of that experience in lieu of my father Graham's recent passing, during a week when I started casually looking for the name that would be printed on the booklet for this release. In the final hour, I ended up compiling the banal information needed for printing. I used the ready marketplace names available on this site called \"A Fictional Species Name Generator.\" My father studied the biologies of birds and mammals as a profession, including chasing a rare brown palm civet (Paradoxurus jerdoni)into his tent while on a top-secret field trip in India. Wouldn't it be curious if he purposefully opened a door into an alternative universe after passing away? Or perchance it could be possible from the material side that someone now living casts a portal opened to the heavens with a musical signal?

The truth was that Bovine, aka Prince Harry, had needed the United States to promote his dream of World Government and when Prince William became King of England and Wales, he wanted to be part of it. The Growth Economy died, people were set free \u2013 to be subsistence farmers, and pure Right Wing became little more than a fond memory.\nThe Climate of Dominion\nLabels: Bovine , Dr James Hansen , Dr. James Hansen , James Hansen , King William , Prince Harry , Prince William , The Climate of Dominion , the Kingdom of England & Wales.\nfrom Fahrenheit to Celsius via the Champs Elys\u00e9es.\nSo let us take a European unit of temperature measurement, and then index to zero, or to normal, or even to merde.

Considered to be deeply rooted in evolutionary history, this group of highly distinctive turtles have been in existence as far back as the Cretaceous period, and were even prominent amidst the non-avian dinosaurs during their hey-day.\nAs far as characteristics and patterns prevalent in the family are concerned, all observed members have demonstrated a keen sense of vision while being less capable in terms of olfactory senses. Their eyes have been revealed to specifically respond to key oscillating signals, a point that could be further adopted in future engineering applications. In the context of reproduction and lifespans, species observed have also tended to live longer, the ratio and proportion of which tend to increase with changing altitude or depth, while remaining male biased.\nOverall, these not-so-familiar portrayals and attributes heavily suggest that these species have had a history that revolved around population size and overpopulation, and it is proposed that fossils of current living members could be found from non-avian dinosaur remains after undergoing relevant fully fledged scientific research procedures.\nGroup 15 focuses primarily on two closely related genera: the Phorvian and Gryvus which share similar evolutionary traits.\nThe main focus in this section would be research on the ability of the freshly hatched turtles to push and crawl their way out of the packed sand of the nesting sites smoothly and efficiently even though they are quite small and weigh little.\n\u00a0The main focus in this section would be the research on the ability of the krill to efficiently swim against the ocean currents and furthermore, how they change directions using changes in their shapes and body structures.\nThe main focus in this section would be research on the unique photoperiodic light detection of the turtle and how the unique photoreceptors affects the turtle\u2019s ability to detect certain frequencies of light which helps the turtle to navigate with relative ease.\n\u00a0The main focus in this section would be the research", "token_ids": [2360, 302, 321, 5808, 627, 18, 5422, 2405, 27663, 198, 19, 12517, 93682, 86945, 5411, 9119, 198, 19, 13, 16, 12517, 25, 2360, 302, 321, 5808, 198, 20, 22241, 315, 51567, 198, 791, 3070, 2360, 302, 321, 5808, 71010, 1403, 84535, 26, 2405, 269, 85, 1122, 323, 99548, 85, 355, 1174, 449, 3697, 33152, 311, 71699, 389, 279, 4363, 323, 9581, 13, 21829, 291, 311, 387, 17693, 41976, 304, 41993, 3925, 11, 420, 1912, 315, 7701, 35947, 72503, 617, 1027, 304, 14209, 439, 3117, 1203, 439, 279, 356, 2171, 77140, 4261, 11, 323, 1051, 1524, 21102, 65904, 279, 2536, 12, 60278, 65375, 2391, 872, 35309, 11477, 627, 2170, 3117, 439, 17910, 323, 12912, 46941, 304, 279, 3070, 527, 11920, 11, 682, 13468, 3697, 617, 21091, 264, 27989, 5647, 315, 11376, 1418, 1694, 2753, 13171, 304, 3878, 315, 8492, 22348, 38207, 13, 11205, 6548, 617, 1027, 10675, 311, 11951, 6013, 311, 1401, 43524, 1113, 17738, 11, 264, 1486, 430, 1436, 387, 4726, 18306, 304, 3938, 15009, 8522, 13, 763, 279, 2317, 315, 39656, 323, 10345, 25632, 598, 11, 9606, 13468, 617, 1101, 49890, 311, 3974, 5129, 11, 279, 11595, 323, 21801, 315, 902, 8541, 311, 5376, 449, 10223, 36958, 477, 8149, 11, 1418, 9861, 8762, 48761, 627, 28589, 11, 1521, 539, 34119, 2269, 41505, 25920, 1147, 323, 8365, 17345, 4284, 430, 1521, 9606, 617, 1047, 264, 3925, 430, 5891, 8905, 2212, 7187, 1404, 323, 927, 45541, 11, 323, 433, 374, 11223, 430, 81473, 315, 1510, 5496, 3697, 1436, 387, 1766, 505, 2536, 12, 60278, 63989, 8625, 1306, 47397, 9959, 7373, 30010, 3640, 12624, 3495, 16346, 627, 2878, 220, 868, 24400, 15871, 389, 1403, 15499, 5552, 84535, 25, 279, 2405, 269, 85, 1122, 323, 99548, 85, 355, 902, 4430, 4528, 41993, 25022, 627, 791, 1925, 5357, 304, 420, 3857, 1053, 387, 3495, 389, 279, 5845, 315, 279, 50999, 305, 35344, 72503, 311, 4585, 323, 46764, 872, 1648, 704, 315, 279, 19937, 9462, 315, 279, 67810, 6732, 39511, 323, 30820, 1524, 3582, 814, 527, 5115, 2678, 323, 17988, 2697, 627, 4194, 791, 1925, 5357, 304, 420, 3857, 1053, 387, 279, 3495, 389, 279, 5845, 315, 279, 23975, 484, 311, 30820, 16587, 2403, 279, 18435, 60701, 323, 78637, 11, 1268, 814, 2349, 18445, 1701, 4442, 304, 872, 21483, 323, 2547, 14726, 627, 791, 1925, 5357, 304, 420, 3857, 1053, 387, 3495, 389, 279, 5016, 4604, 3376, 3205, 292, 3177, 18468, 315, 279, 37189, 323, 1268, 279, 5016, 4604, 461, 58650, 22223, 279, 37189, 753, 5845, 311, 11388, 3738, 34873, 315, 3177, 902, 8779, 279, 37189, 311, 21546, 449, 8844, 14553, 627, 4194, 791, 1925, 5357, 304, 420, 3857, 1053, 387, 279, 3495], "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}]}, {"request_id": "3160", "prompt": "Kryo follows the time zone of Eryndor.

The design goals and algorithms are well documented, and the entire project has been released under GNU General Public Version 2 license. The code is written by Salvador Dali and is available at GitHub here:\nhttps://github.com/redsquare/platypus\nSal Dali, the nom de guerre of the designer of this algorithm, is part of the software-development team of the Tor Project. You may have heard of Tor \u2014 that is the p2p obfuscation project originally designed, implemented, and deployed by the United States Naval Research Laboratory as an open-source way to allow citizens to bypass the information blockades of oppressive regimes. However, over the past several years, it has also become a way for oppressed citizens to bypass surveillance blockades by oppressive regimes. In fact the Tor Project gets most of its financial support from the Naval Research Lab.\n[By the way, if you believe that there is no technology whose purpose is not subverted from its original intent by its prolonged application, you are not alone. Some of the world\u2019s smartest people have reached the same conclusion.]\nThere are plenty of reasons for using Tor. For example, what if you lived in a country where there was no legal way to engage in political discourse because it was forbidden by law to talk about some topics.

These questions are drawn from the wonderful book of riddles and mind-benders by Shane Snow that came out last year called Smartcuts . It\u2019s a fantastic compilation of tricks and hacks to get you thinking and solving irrational or counter-intuitive problems in more simplistic ways.\nIf you were intrigued by the vending machine problem , then you\u2019ll love Smartcuts.\nPeace.\n\nI thought sorting algorithms were quite the dried up old\u00a0topic but I realized today that it is something to which I keep returning. Some years ago,\u00a0the inefficiency and inherent complexity in handling large data sets using the standard Bubble , Merge or Quick-Sort techniques made me take note of this shortcoming, even with the improvements suggested by Knuth.\nNot long ago,\u00a0I returned to the topic to see what other work has been done to address the main performance bottleneck with sorting large amounts of data \u2013 the inherent O(n) (linear) time to access each data element for a list of size n . That is when I first stumbled across Content Addressable Data Structures which allow for O(1) (constant) time access to data.\nToday I saw a presentation of a Python script implementation of a relatively unknown radix (base) sorting technique known as the Pigeonhole Sort . This sort performs better than Quick-Sort in certain\u00a0scenarios months and found that it is not really new at all. It is in fact just a derivative of the radix sort method first published by\u00a0Herbert J.\u00a0Radke in 1975 . The scripting.com implementation used a\u00a0key. In computer terms, a\u00a0key\u00a0is a value that is used to group together data that are associated with that value.\nSo I decided to look a little deeper at radix sorting in general, using the Pigeonhole technique as a simple representation. Consider a collection of n numeric values using the base 10 number system:\n    - Find the min (lowest) and max (highest) values in the list\n    - Assuming pore-positive integers, calculate the exponent of the max 10 -based number which will determine the max number of times the pigeonhole technique is to be implemented to", "token_ids": [6063, 382, 4012, 7344, 539, 13, 4314, 4860, 527, 15107, 505, 279, 11364, 2363, 315, 436, 78555, 323, 4059, 1481, 14846, 555, 51075, 19435, 430, 3782, 704, 1566, 1060, 2663, 16147, 23312, 662, 1102, 753, 264, 14964, 29772, 315, 29862, 323, 60884, 311, 636, 499, 7422, 323, 22581, 61754, 477, 5663, 20653, 35251, 5435, 304, 810, 78630, 5627, 627, 2746, 499, 1051, 69118, 555, 279, 86144, 5780, 3575, 1174, 1243, 499, 4805, 3021, 16147, 23312, 627, 85743, 382, 40, 3463, 29373, 26249, 1051, 5115, 279, 32720, 709, 2362, 4194, 16816, 719, 358, 15393, 3432, 430, 433, 374, 2555, 311, 902, 358, 2567, 13758, 13, 4427, 1667, 4227, 11, 4194, 1820, 90325, 10603, 323, 38088, 23965, 304, 11850, 3544, 828, 7437, 1701, 279, 5410, 54424, 1174, 41185, 477, 17697, 6354, 371, 12823, 1903, 757, 1935, 5296, 315, 420, 2875, 5065, 11, 1524, 449, 279, 18637, 12090, 555, 13934, 952, 627, 2688, 1317, 4227, 11, 4194, 40, 6052, 311, 279, 8712, 311, 1518, 1148, 1023, 990, 706, 1027, 2884, 311, 2686, 279, 1925, 5178, 88938, 449, 29373, 3544, 15055, 315, 828, 1389, 279, 38088, 507, 1471, 8, 320, 23603, 8, 892, 311, 2680, 1855, 828, 2449, 369, 264, 1160, 315, 1404, 308, 662, 3011, 374, 994, 358, 1176, 50157, 4028, 9059, 9356, 481, 2956, 71150, 902, 2187, 369, 507, 7, 16, 8, 320, 18568, 8, 892, 2680, 311, 828, 627, 15724, 358, 5602, 264, 15864, 315, 264, 13325, 5429, 8292, 315, 264, 12309, 9987, 76758, 320, 3231, 8, 29373, 15105, 3967, 439, 279, 393, 7404, 263, 31520, 16347, 662, 1115, 3460, 27772, 2731, 1109, 17697, 6354, 371, 304, 3738, 4194, 2445, 61594, 4038, 323, 1766, 430, 433, 374, 539, 2216, 502, 520, 682, 13, 1102, 374, 304, 2144, 1120, 264, 32905, 315, 279, 76758, 3460, 1749, 1176, 4756, 555, 4194, 21364, 9339, 622, 13, 4194, 43031, 441, 304, 220, 4468, 20, 662, 578, 68522, 916, 8292, 1511, 264, 4194, 798, 13, 763, 6500, 3878, 11, 264, 4194, 798, 4194, 285, 264, 907, 430, 374, 1511, 311, 1912, 3871, 828, 430, 527, 5938, 449, 430, 907, 627, 4516, 358, 6773, 311, 1427, 264, 2697, 19662, 520, 76758, 29373, 304, 4689, 11, 1701, 279, 393, 7404, 263, 31520, 15105, 439, 264, 4382, 13340, 13, 21829, 264, 4526, 315, 308, 25031, 2819, 1701, 279, 2385, 220, 605, 1396, 1887, 512, 262, 482, 7531, 279, 1332, 320, 90998, 8, 323, 1973, 320, 75254, 8, 2819, 304, 279, 1160, 198, 262, 482, 65064, 97551, 69788, 26864, 11, 11294, 279, 28790, 315, 279, 1973, 220, 605, 482, 31039, 1396, 902, 690, 8417, 279, 1973, 1396, 315, 3115, 279, 93644, 31520, 15105, 374, 311, 387, 11798, 311], "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}]}, {"request_id": "3189", "prompt": "Tyseria is a city in the state of Fendrel.

Its snout was long and narrow, with many teeth. The animal\u2019s body was slender, with a long tail.\nXyphodon was an omnivore, eating both plants and small animals. It may have also scavenged for carrion.\nXyphodon is one of the earliest known Synapsids. It is also the only Synapsid known from Madagascar.\nThe genus Xyphodon was first described in 2013. It is named after the Greek words xyphon (meaning sharp) and odon (meaning tooth).\nXyphodon is classified in the order Cynodontia. This order includes all Synapsids, as well as the transitional form Synapsida .\nXyphodon belongs to the family Younginiformes . Younginiformes is a group of primitive Synapsids that lived during the Early Triassic Period.\nXyphodon hatrinae is the only known species of Xyphodon. It was named after Ms. Hatrina, the discoverer of the fossils.\nMs. Hatrina was walking along a beach in Madagascar when she found some strange bones.

Anthropologists, Ivor Hughes and Lionel Tiger have used the concept of descent group to explain social groupings within tribal societies and examine the effects of modern political and cultural change on these groups. What is meant by the term descent group?\nDescent is that part of a kinship system that identifies a person\u2019s genealogical affiliation: i.e., descent group or line, or who you are descended from. The system upon which a kinship group is established depends on the society in which it is found. There are a number of different systems but all systems will trace relations of some form through either the mother\u2019s or father\u2019s line.\nUNILINEAL : A unilineal descent system is one in which the kids of one sex are thought of as related to their father exclusively (and not to their mother) or their mother exclusively (and not to their father). Most unilineal systems have a joint house in which the descent group live and share property ownership. This means that only a man\u2019s son\u2019s or a woman\u2019s daughter\u2019s maintain the firm ties to the family. One half of the family is linked to the father and one half to the mother, but the family as a whole has only one last name.\nMATRILINEAL : A matrilineal descent system is one in which a person can trace his or her \u201cblood\u201d descent through the mother. It is the blood ties a person has with his or her maternal kin. Therefore a male matrilineal heir inherits from his uncle, who is his mother\u2019s brother, rather than from his father. This system forms the basis of a matrilineal clan, which is a social group formed by tracing the descent of maternal kin. There are some matrilineal societies supported by strong social ties between a female and her brother, as opposed to her husband. A matrilineal descent system is often associated with a society where women occupy the primary role as cultivators of soil and have the", "token_ids": [8683, 11, 7639, 279, 38950, 315, 8388, 11, 7505, 279, 38950, 315, 4488, 11, 36035, 279, 38950, 315, 30505, 1981, 578, 4007, 315, 24890, 12135, 323, 872, 4495, 1005, 315, 24890, 3878, 7739, 459, 3062, 13189, 315, 3674, 95044, 13, 70384, 22012, 11, 34583, 269, 41411, 323, 84224, 36845, 617, 1511, 279, 7434, 315, 38052, 1912, 311, 10552, 3674, 1912, 826, 2949, 40489, 34775, 323, 21635, 279, 6372, 315, 6617, 5054, 323, 13042, 2349, 389, 1521, 5315, 13, 3639, 374, 8967, 555, 279, 4751, 38052, 1912, 5380, 5001, 1189, 374, 430, 961, 315, 264, 24890, 5383, 1887, 430, 36611, 264, 1732, 753, 15207, 32051, 950, 53891, 25, 602, 1770, 2637, 38052, 1912, 477, 1584, 11, 477, 889, 499, 527, 58842, 505, 13, 578, 1887, 5304, 902, 264, 24890, 5383, 1912, 374, 9749, 14117, 389, 279, 8396, 304, 902, 433, 374, 1766, 13, 2684, 527, 264, 1396, 315, 2204, 6067, 719, 682, 6067, 690, 11917, 4398, 315, 1063, 1376, 1555, 3060, 279, 6691, 753, 477, 7126, 753, 1584, 627, 1899, 96682, 984, 551, 362, 653, 27658, 278, 38052, 1887, 374, 832, 304, 902, 279, 6980, 315, 832, 1877, 527, 3463, 315, 439, 5552, 311, 872, 7126, 24121, 320, 438, 539, 311, 872, 6691, 8, 477, 872, 6691, 24121, 320, 438, 539, 311, 872, 7126, 570, 7648, 653, 27658, 278, 6067, 617, 264, 10496, 3838, 304, 902, 279, 38052, 1912, 3974, 323, 4430, 3424, 15637, 13, 1115, 3445, 430, 1193, 264, 893, 753, 4538, 753, 477, 264, 5333, 753, 10003, 753, 10519, 279, 7626, 20405, 311, 279, 3070, 13, 3861, 4376, 315, 279, 3070, 374, 10815, 311, 279, 7126, 323, 832, 4376, 311, 279, 6691, 11, 719, 279, 3070, 439, 264, 4459, 706, 1193, 832, 1566, 836, 627, 57989, 49, 96682, 984, 551, 362, 5634, 81, 27658, 278, 38052, 1887, 374, 832, 304, 902, 264, 1732, 649, 11917, 813, 477, 1077, 1054, 51105, 863, 38052, 1555, 279, 6691, 13, 1102, 374, 279, 6680, 20405, 264, 1732, 706, 449, 813, 477, 1077, 50150, 24890, 13, 15636, 264, 8762, 5634, 81, 27658, 278, 51543, 76582, 505, 813, 38594, 11, 889, 374, 813, 6691, 753, 10868, 11, 4856, 1109, 505, 813, 7126, 13, 1115, 1887, 7739, 279, 8197, 315, 264, 5634, 81, 27658, 278, 39562, 11, 902, 374, 264, 3674, 1912, 14454, 555, 46515, 279, 38052, 315, 50150, 24890, 13, 2684, 527, 1063, 5634, 81, 27658, 278, 34775, 7396, 555, 3831, 3674, 20405, 1990, 264, 8954, 323, 1077, 10868, 11, 439, 16475, 311, 1077, 10177, 13, 362, 5634, 81, 27658, 278, 38052, 1887, 374, 3629, 5938, 449, 264, 8396, 1405, 3278, 48678, 279, 6156, 3560, 439, 27981, 3046, 315, 17614, 323, 617, 279], "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}]}, {"request_id": "3239", "prompt": "Sam is the father of Alex.

This negates the conclusion because if this statement were true, Ytheris would also be in Marendor, and thus Ytheris and Vynora would not share a country.\nAnswer C tells us that Eryndor and Balthorien are part of the same zone. Were this to be true, we would still not be able to connect Ytheris to Vynora.\nAnswer D tells us that Marendor and Vesperon share border, but while this connects Marendor and Vesperon, it does not connect Ytheris and Vynora across these countries.\nFinally, Answer E tells us that Noctari shares a border with every other state in Balthorien. Remember, however, that Noctari, itself, does not share the country with Ytheris, and so knowing more", "token_ids": [279, 1890, 3224, 439, 650, 1910, 6347, 13, 16299, 315, 279, 2768, 12518, 11, 422, 837, 11, 1455, 96236, 279, 3485, 5811, 5380, 1687, 2351, 3309, 430, 2999, 300, 374, 264, 3363, 304, 279, 1614, 315, 435, 408, 3833, 11, 735, 97234, 374, 264, 3363, 304, 279, 1614, 315, 507, 764, 404, 290, 11, 323, 507, 764, 404, 290, 374, 264, 1614, 304, 279, 3224, 386, 53945, 269, 13, 1226, 2351, 1243, 3309, 430, 816, 700, 285, 374, 264, 3363, 304, 279, 1614, 315, 11730, 2465, 969, 11, 650, 1910, 6347, 374, 264, 3363, 304, 279, 1614, 315, 2360, 302, 2850, 11, 323, 11730, 2465, 969, 374, 264, 1614, 304, 279, 3224, 650, 70138, 263, 11, 323, 435, 408, 3833, 323, 2360, 302, 2850, 527, 2225, 5415, 304, 279, 3224, 426, 1902, 269, 3675, 13, 14636, 11, 279, 17102, 2011, 387, 430, 584, 1440, 430, 816, 700, 285, 1587, 353, 1962, 9, 4430, 264, 3224, 449, 650, 1910, 6347, 627, 16533, 362, 10975, 603, 430, 2999, 300, 323, 650, 1910, 6347, 4430, 264, 9474, 11, 323, 279, 2472, 499, 24465, 1288, 617, 279, 4113, 9919, 14738, 93858, 11, 323, 9093, 584, 2351, 3309, 1618, 430, 2999, 300, 323, 650, 1910, 6347, 527, 3345, 311, 1855, 1023, 389, 279, 2472, 13, 4452, 11, 279, 31646, 389, 420, 3488, 374, 311, 1427, 369, 2555, 311, 72319, 279, 17102, 11, 323, 9093, 584, 2351, 4560, 311, 4546, 650, 1910, 6347, 323, 816, 700, 285, 3871, 11, 902, 2999, 300, 649, 956, 1520, 311, 656, 627, 16533, 426, 10975, 603, 430, 735, 97234, 323, 816, 700, 285, 4430, 264, 9474, 13, 1115, 4277, 988, 279, 17102, 1606, 422, 420, 5224, 1051, 837, 11, 816, 700, 285, 1053, 1101, 387, 304, 386, 53945, 269, 11, 323, 8617, 816, 700, 285, 323, 650, 1910, 6347, 1053, 539, 4430, 264, 3224, 627, 16533, 356, 10975, 603, 430, 469, 894, 303, 269, 323, 426, 1902, 269, 3675, 527, 961, 315, 279, 1890, 10353, 13, 40070, 420, 311, 387, 837, 11, 584, 1053, 2103, 539, 387, 3025, 311, 4667, 816, 700, 285, 311, 650, 1910, 6347, 627, 16533, 423, 10975, 603, 430, 386, 53945, 269, 323, 650, 70138, 263, 4430, 3973, 11, 719, 1418, 420, 34161, 386, 53945, 269, 323, 650, 70138, 263, 11, 433, 1587, 539, 4667, 816, 700, 285, 323, 650, 1910, 6347, 4028, 1521, 5961, 627, 24901, 11, 22559, 469, 10975, 603, 430, 2360, 302, 2850, 13551, 264, 3973, 449, 1475, 1023, 1614, 304, 426, 1902, 269, 3675, 13, 20474, 11, 4869, 11, 430, 2360, 302, 2850, 11, 5196, 11, 1587, 539, 4430, 279, 3224, 449, 816, 700, 285, 11, 323, 779, 14392, 810], "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}]}, {"request_id": "3264", "prompt": "Jack is the mother of Anna.

It hasn\u2019t been easy carving out a home here in the Rifts. The Humans of Balthorien lived in nomadic caravans for years, eventually settling on the only viable planet in the system: Nereum. Because of it\u2019s dense molecular composition, Engineers could not safely harvest individual sections of the planet for construction, as they would with a planet that is less geologically dense. Nereum is stable, hollow, asymmetrical and - perhaps accommodating of all things wrong - it is a phantom of spectral consequence.\nIn Earth mythology, Balthorien is the keeper of soldiers whose spirits remained in Hroth, the human afterlife, and were not ready to fade away. In Reniera, it is the same. The afflictions of war have deeply scarred the skin of the culture across the galaxy. The scars are evident in religious rites and practices, in the stories told through song and art, in the very persona of all Humans. Humans in Balthorien no longer lust for war as they did in the early years of the Republic, that insatiable appetite to prove strength has long since dissipated - though even today the scars of that former civilization may yet haunt Humanity\u2019s straits.\nThough there is one constant, and it is the bloodshot current of the Navy, coursing through Humanity - the ever-present shadow of any government - the need to protect its own.\nThe Military of Balthorien\nJoining the military before reaching the age of eighty five has been outlawed since the Great Purge of 30716, a reformation reminiscent of the U.S. War in the Woods. The result of this decision is an ongoing and relentless recruitment cycle; today, the majority of Balthorien citizens today identify to", "token_ids": [426, 1902, 269, 3675, 11, 650, 35472, 689, 374, 2380, 4207, 8469, 315, 50733, 299, 339, 11, 386, 53945, 269, 374, 2380, 4207, 4920, 79562, 716, 263, 11, 507, 764, 404, 290, 374, 2380, 4207, 8469, 315, 816, 700, 285, 11, 323, 779, 389, 627, 791, 11346, 323, 21023, 315, 426, 1902, 269, 3675, 198, 2028, 6917, 1887, 11, 1093, 1057, 1866, 13238, 1887, 11, 374, 264, 9622, 315, 1080, 3916, 6253, 81967, 5724, 323, 8987, 55479, 5151, 13, 1102, 12775, 1431, 1027, 4228, 77791, 704, 264, 2162, 1618, 304, 279, 57427, 82, 13, 578, 66094, 315, 426, 1902, 269, 3675, 12439, 304, 9859, 37314, 1841, 402, 598, 369, 1667, 11, 9778, 52945, 389, 279, 1193, 31528, 11841, 304, 279, 1887, 25, 452, 486, 372, 13, 9393, 315, 433, 753, 29050, 31206, 18528, 11, 49796, 1436, 539, 21676, 24322, 3927, 14491, 315, 279, 11841, 369, 8246, 11, 439, 814, 1053, 449, 264, 11841, 430, 374, 2753, 3980, 30450, 29050, 13, 452, 486, 372, 374, 15528, 11, 42902, 11, 54395, 59402, 323, 482, 8530, 77141, 315, 682, 2574, 5076, 482, 433, 374, 264, 70808, 315, 57077, 29774, 627, 644, 9420, 59492, 11, 426, 1902, 269, 3675, 374, 279, 54516, 315, 15201, 6832, 31739, 14958, 304, 473, 299, 339, 11, 279, 3823, 1306, 14789, 11, 323, 1051, 539, 5644, 311, 15366, 3201, 13, 763, 14094, 26919, 11, 433, 374, 279, 1890, 13, 578, 95623, 919, 315, 4208, 617, 17693, 23087, 1171, 279, 6930, 315, 279, 7829, 4028, 279, 34261, 13, 578, 61699, 527, 30576, 304, 10597, 99552, 323, 12659, 11, 304, 279, 7493, 3309, 1555, 5609, 323, 1989, 11, 304, 279, 1633, 29055, 315, 682, 66094, 13, 66094, 304, 426, 1902, 269, 3675, 912, 5129, 41202, 369, 4208, 439, 814, 1550, 304, 279, 4216, 1667, 315, 279, 5545, 11, 430, 1672, 266, 2205, 38575, 311, 12391, 8333, 706, 1317, 2533, 14091, 63332, 482, 3582, 1524, 3432, 279, 61699, 315, 430, 4846, 36017, 1253, 3686, 84758, 83695, 753, 610, 57579, 627, 27831, 1070, 374, 832, 6926, 11, 323, 433, 374, 279, 6680, 6474, 1510, 315, 279, 19574, 11, 45369, 287, 1555, 83695, 482, 279, 3596, 49124, 12737, 315, 904, 3109, 482, 279, 1205, 311, 6144, 1202, 1866, 627, 791, 28058, 315, 426, 1902, 269, 3675, 198, 12572, 287, 279, 6411, 1603, 19261, 279, 4325, 315, 80679, 4330, 706, 1027, 65106, 291, 2533, 279, 8681, 14874, 713, 315, 220, 14777, 845, 11, 264, 312, 1659, 56085, 315, 279, 549, 815, 13, 5111, 304, 279, 35848, 13, 578, 1121, 315, 420, 5597, 374, 459, 14529, 323, 60135, 34102, 11008, 26, 3432, 11, 279, 8857, 315, 426, 1902, 269, 3675, 10495, 3432, 10765, 311], "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}]}, {"request_id": "3273", "prompt": "Balthorien follows the time zone of Xyphodon.

Extreme injuries harm the condition, starting with low chance of ~15% and reaching to a 100% certainty of Wounded condition at 9.99% Body. The exact numbers are still to be determined.\nBeing Exhausted will blunt the mind. Exhausted condition will negate every other condition bonus except Strength and must be fixed at a Healing Artefact before the condition can be reset to Withered. This speeds up the exhaustion process.\nCornered Enemies start to act frenzied and get a bonus from their attacks and skills. If the player acts aggressively, the enemies will act aggressively themselves, as well.\nAttacking someone without warning makes the player mean, increasing bonus damage to unique monsters (including signature monsters, construct, or golems) but penalises renown increase per kill. Reputations for some orgs also take a hit (e.g. Sect of Metal). Specifically, attacking adventurers, NPC villagers, or non-hostile NPCs makes you mean.\nBeing Peaceful acts in contrast to being mean. If a player does not attack others without warning and either trying to escape if attacked, or sacrificing resources will increase the peacefulness after situation. Good reputation increase between certain orgs, e.g. Sect of Metal, will be higher when acting peacefully.\nThe economy is based on finite, persistent player mules.

Therefore Fendrel must be south of Marendor and Xyphodon. It cannot be south of Xyphodon because then Zorvath would be south of Glacidae. Moreover, it cannot be east or west of Xyphodon, so it must be to the north, separated from Xyphodon by Kylo. Zorvath is not three hours south of Kylo, so it must be to the east and Fendrel must be to the west. By this chain of deductions Zorvath, Vesperon and Kylo must be in that order along the horizon west of Xyphodon.

Umbrithis is located in the man made canyons of the Ollasus Mtns. All of the rivers of Kryo run either to the north or to the west.

The ocean to the south of Ashwood bay is the Balliens Ocean, after Balien the founder of Havroth who was not only the first person to discover the other continents, but also the first to circumnavigate Darcadia.

To do this, where most people would have done a brute force 6 loop, a 1-second runtime on any machine, instead the following solution iterates over the characters of the respective city, state, country, etc. The reason for doing this is the %c character, because the input is one string, and each time you have to read a character, the entire thing is re-worked to prepare for the next character.

You can also manage different servers under a single time converter.\nSome of you have noticed the Vulkan,theRoboCowbro nobody enjoys them however is there nothing that we can do to get rid of them...\nHow many say in a wum in total for battle sack", "token_ids": [445, 10318, 710, 627, 2746, 499, 527, 304, 426, 1902, 269, 3675, 11, 650, 1910, 6347, 11, 56208, 299, 339, 11, 14221, 805, 689, 1131, 650, 70138, 263, 323, 8444, 582, 114405, 527, 1243, 220, 18, 4207, 8469, 13, 1442, 499, 527, 304, 650, 70138, 263, 11, 8444, 582, 114405, 11, 2360, 302, 2850, 477, 1901, 269, 85, 589, 18575, 445, 10318, 710, 323, 24218, 1347, 411, 285, 527, 1243, 220, 18, 4207, 8469, 323, 426, 1902, 269, 3675, 11, 650, 1910, 6347, 11, 56208, 299, 339, 323, 14221, 805, 689, 527, 220, 18, 4207, 4920, 13, 82671, 11, 422, 499, 527, 304, 445, 10318, 710, 477, 24218, 1347, 411, 285, 1243, 426, 1902, 269, 3675, 11, 650, 1910, 6347, 11, 56208, 299, 339, 323, 14221, 805, 689, 374, 220, 18, 4207, 8469, 323, 650, 70138, 263, 11, 8444, 582, 114405, 11, 2360, 302, 2850, 323, 1901, 269, 85, 589, 527, 1243, 220, 18, 4207, 4920, 627, 71903, 279, 1567, 892, 4375, 1093, 420, 791, 1567, 374, 21685, 555, 832, 1732, 389, 832, 3622, 4869, 994, 814, 1160, 279, 1567, 892, 814, 617, 311, 1614, 902, 3116, 16692, 611, 1712, 68634, 814, 690, 387, 1701, 13, 1115, 3445, 430, 279, 16692, 430, 527, 220, 18, 4207, 4920, 636, 311, 1518, 279, 1567, 220, 18, 4207, 4216, 323, 4311, 430, 527, 220, 18, 4207, 8469, 690, 636, 311, 1518, 279, 1567, 220, 18, 4207, 3389, 627, 2520, 3187, 11, 422, 5348, 339, 17334, 374, 20256, 459, 1567, 520, 220, 972, 25, 410, 9012, 650, 1910, 6347, 11, 1243, 4311, 304, 1630, 15619, 77152, 690, 387, 3025, 311, 1684, 279, 1567, 520, 220, 868, 25, 410, 4619, 315, 220, 972, 25, 410, 627, 18621, 57602, 68387, 4419, 198, 2181, 1053, 1101, 387, 5922, 7231, 6261, 264, 2731, 8830, 315, 35988, 892, 89988, 1093, 4435, 27234, 40428, 323, 1023, 6732, 430, 2187, 499, 311, 1518, 279, 892, 304, 2204, 5596, 315, 279, 1917, 13, 1472, 649, 1101, 10299, 2204, 16692, 1234, 264, 3254, 892, 28157, 627, 8538, 315, 499, 617, 14000, 279, 86964, 63738, 14804, 78, 91015, 15222, 19093, 32838, 1124, 4869, 374, 1070, 4400, 430, 584, 649, 656, 311, 636, 9463, 315, 1124, 9522, 4438, 1690, 2019, 304, 264, 289, 372, 304, 2860, 369, 8209, 53433, 128001], "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}]}, {"request_id": "3346", "prompt": "Kate is the father of Amy.

Vynora is three hours ahead of Noctari.\nIn order to steer a course for Vynora from Zorvath, when leaving port, one would steer due north nine degrees east. Well south of the equator one would come upon the Strait of Shedetang. This is a very narrow passage between the mainland and the northern cape of Vynora. Due to the narrowness, it is named the Strait of Shedetang rather than Shedetang Bay, despite the bay being nonexistent to the north. You must either sail safely through this passage or detour around the north. Although the detour adds an extra day, the detouring route is often preferred by larger merchant ships. A large ship must always be wary of pirates and unfavorable winds and currents while in such confined routes. Though it is a pain to dock safely in the region, the chance for loot (and furs) can be very enticing to a pirate. It is essential that no vessel is to travel through this route during a strong Northern current. A vessel trying to travel would lose momentum too fast and be pushed up against Cape Shelmeer. With a swift force, one will rip a hole through the hull, and capsize, crumble, or destroy the ship. As with many straits, the southern current is the best way to travel through Shedetang Strait. Though don't let that fool you. There are currents causing waves that crash up over 40 feet along its shores.\nThere is only one reasonable course when leaving port for Havroth in one's route to Luminax. At first, one should steer due north nine degrees west. Approximately after a week from port, one will want to break off from Eryndor. Approximately another week will have brought you to the Eryndor Strait. You are then to pass through (to the south of) Vynora, as you pass the Wyrjemor Passage.

Both arguments are valid, because if the premises were true, then the conclusion would be guaranteed to be true as well. But only the first argument's premises are true. Therefore, only the first one has a true conclusion. The third one is invalid. So, that doesn't mean it is irrational. The second one is a bad argument, which accepts and uses premises obviously intended to be taken as true, but the last two are simply confusing, since the reader is expected to (correctly) dismiss false and unsound arguments. The second argument is the best example of an unsound argument in common usage. The first argument is both sound and rational.

Similarly, given that Fendrel is to Russian as Noctari is to Mandarin , then it follows that a horizontal relationship is implied. Combining these two notions reveals that there are translations moving in a single direction. Further simplifying is possible through knowing that the only relationship between two of the translations is found between G and Kryo . Therefore, the only plausible options are 1(Horizontal) and 4 (Horizontal and Vertical) .\nThis can be further distilled by considering that the only translation that shares both a Horizontal and Vertical relationship is English and Xyphodon .

Aulosian phenomenon: that samples become harder to recognize as they age. According to the Hasban hypothesis, samples found at a relatively new site would likely not be unrecognizable. According to the Aulosian phenomenon, the problem with identifying samples gets worse if time is allowed to pass. Given these two statements, Bowser's discovery of unrecognizable remains at a 400-year-old archaeological site does not make sense. If neither statement is true, then Bowser's discovery may be correct. Another idea: If the samples are old from both the Hasban and Aulosian viewpoints, then Bowser's observations are wrong. If we know that the samples are old enough, but do not know if they are new or old, then Bowser's observations are not necessarily wrong.\nZemanix is an ozone-producing industrial chemical. Our air monitors have shown an increase in ozone levels in the city. Zemanix is being released unchecked into the air because the current air filters do not restrict it. Industries that deal with zemanix undergo regular checks to make sure no zemanix is leaking out. It is known that zemanix seeps through old air filters. If the alarms are not set off when zemanix is detected, that means either the alarms are malfunctioning or the filters are letting it through. Tonight the zemanix alarms were set off. The swarms of flying insects near the Z.X.Q. fertilizer factory has decreased in recent years due to the installation of ozone filters.\nSince zemanix has harmful effects on human health, it should be checked for in every industry. The air quality in industrial areas has improved since the invention of zemanix. Zemanix is not known to be released by any other chemical or industry.

A woman named Rosalyn was her lover. The Coraxlins at that time became uncontrollable and couldn\u2019t be stopped with tactictix or queen sorcery. Many villages were ruined by them. Roselyn had the power of Greenblood. Roselyn wanted Ellamore to embrace the chaos when Genghus Damphien, Ellamore\u2019s father and the former lord of the land, would not accept Ellamore as his heir, and wanted the Well to open up so that anyone could learn sorcery. Genghus Damphien argued that greenblood didn\u2019t make Roslyn a suitable candidate for queen admin. Using her sorcery to find a husband, Ellamore refused to marry Roselyn. The marriage between Sorana and Ellamore ended in divorce. For her, Ellamore held deep affection. She sent Greenblood to Roselyn in order to regain Azshara\u2019s memory.

Statement II follows from Statement I and is, in fact, a correct conclusion. Therefore, statement II can be logically inferred from Statement I.\nAnswer Option 3 Explanation\nThe problems in this set are all based on taxonomy. In the problem above, you are given a number of different six-inch-long, two-inch-wide blocks, each representing a families. Your job is to reconstruct, based on the hints given in the stimulus, the relationship between the various taxa. Taxa are simply different levels of classification (i.e. Species, genus, family). The chart above shows the hierarchical structure of the stimulus. It shows that the species Aerinth is in the genus Noctilura, Yvorith is inthe genus Seraphid, Thalorium is in the genus Dranthidea and Fluxilus is inthe genus Phorvian.

Luminax has a variable time, meaning the hours or days of the light theme can be overwritten and set to any value. Typically, by default it is 3,5 or 2 hours and is quartered into custom-made times that are generated client-side. (Mindscapeie?) The system is hardcoded, meaning there is no need for inspiration in changing or managing times. The Client will coordinate things by installing and calibrating the Luminax timeline. A certain dynamic fluidity of space is used during the transport to places, like going to Tindras, which provides a relaxed stretching space, where the distance to Aria is shortened to a few meters. Plasma jumping on the other hand might instantly accelerate a player across the map. Ytheris relies on Luminax time and is fully controlled by the insane schedule of the little planet's lighter hemisphere, as it draws in full energy from the suns of Luminax. Noctari on the other hand may have days be sorted after a constructivist calendar, where months are split in half or are two months instead of one. Xyphodon has been reported to pull out weeks together and merge them into a larger fusion as it coordinates a duel Doomsday Planet with the more remote colony", "token_ids": [445, 10318, 710, 320, 32, 3177, 7057, 570, 816, 700, 285, 374, 2380, 4207, 8469, 315, 11730, 2465, 969, 320, 2127, 95673, 7057, 6266, 1630, 88, 764, 77152, 374, 2380, 4207, 8469, 315, 507, 764, 404, 290, 320, 32, 12538, 7057, 7057, 705, 323, 24218, 1347, 411, 374, 2380, 4207, 8469, 315, 650, 1910, 6347, 320, 14364, 6453, 7057, 4390, 99684, 311, 743, 904, 445, 10318, 710, 1122, 47804, 4539, 88, 706, 2744, 1027, 5115, 264, 21426, 12, 505, 4382, 29862, 311, 31818, 279, 364, 1954, 4520, 6, 824, 1938, 311, 30829, 279, 4459, 11841, 304, 279, 6211, 315, 264, 49782, 8385, 355, 13619, 477, 459, 24746, 1665, 482, 1093, 264, 10264, 13, 13440, 1778, 4211, 649, 387, 46836, 304, 279, 350, 789, 10649, 4817, 11, 374, 44003, 13, 578, 1646, 584, 617, 12146, 11, 374, 4762, 279, 1456, 539, 311, 1781, 922, 433, 2288, 2653, 11, 3428, 95852, 5603, 311, 892, 6373, 389, 445, 10318, 710, 13, 1115, 374, 961, 315, 1148, 374, 2663, 279, 445, 10318, 710, 15852, 31933, 11, 7086, 1306, 279, 2998, 11943, 676, 25912, 2786, 13, 445, 10318, 710, 706, 264, 3977, 892, 11, 7438, 279, 4207, 477, 2919, 315, 279, 3177, 7057, 649, 387, 60273, 323, 743, 311, 904, 907, 13, 46402, 11, 555, 1670, 433, 374, 220, 18, 11, 20, 477, 220, 17, 4207, 323, 374, 8502, 291, 1139, 2587, 27975, 3115, 430, 527, 8066, 3016, 25034, 13, 320, 44, 8843, 5443, 648, 10380, 578, 1887, 374, 94059, 11, 7438, 1070, 374, 912, 1205, 369, 20343, 304, 10223, 477, 18646, 3115, 13, 578, 8589, 690, 16580, 2574, 555, 27730, 323, 1652, 10892, 1113, 279, 445, 10318, 710, 25845, 13, 362, 3738, 8915, 15962, 488, 315, 3634, 374, 1511, 2391, 279, 7710, 311, 7634, 11, 1093, 2133, 311, 350, 485, 13075, 11, 902, 5825, 264, 31467, 42949, 3634, 11, 1405, 279, 6138, 311, 362, 4298, 374, 66663, 311, 264, 2478, 20645, 13, 65632, 30102, 389, 279, 1023, 1450, 2643, 22571, 43880, 264, 2851, 4028, 279, 2472, 13, 816, 700, 285, 34744, 389, 445, 10318, 710, 892, 323, 374, 7373, 14400, 555, 279, 35118, 9899, 315, 279, 2697, 11841, 596, 30673, 69766, 11, 439, 433, 27741, 304, 2539, 4907, 505, 279, 7160, 82, 315, 445, 10318, 710, 13, 2360, 302, 2850, 389, 279, 1023, 1450, 1253, 617, 2919, 387, 10839, 1306, 264, 9429, 80244, 13470, 11, 1405, 4038, 527, 6859, 304, 4376, 477, 527, 1403, 4038, 4619, 315, 832, 13, 1630, 88, 764, 77152, 706, 1027, 5068, 311, 6958, 704, 5672, 3871, 323, 11117, 1124, 1139, 264, 8294, 37608, 439, 433, 14259, 264, 66407, 3234, 7085, 1316, 29935, 449, 279, 810, 8870, 42036], "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}]}, {"request_id": "3604", "prompt": "Havroth is a city in the state of Solmyra.

Even as a young child, I was the one my friends and family members would go to when they needed help finding a solution to something. For me, it was just something that came naturally. So, when I came across the world of puzzles, it was like a whole new realm had opened up to me. Puzzles allowed me to not only flex my problem-solving muscles, but to also challenge myself and think outside the box. From jigsaw puzzles to riddles, each one provided a unique and engaging experience that always left me feeling satisfied. But it wasn't just the solving part that I enjoyed, it was also the process of understanding the inner workings of a puzzle. The way certain pieces fit together or how a riddle fooled me into thinking one thing, but actually meant another. It was like a constant learning experience, and I couldn't get enough of it. As I delved deeper into the world of puzzles, I discovered new and intricate ones that pushed my limits even further. Some tests were conflicting and required a sharp eye for details, while others needed a creative mind to piece together the solution. It was an adventure that I eagerly embraced, always up for the challenge. It was through puzzles that I found a community of like-minded individuals who shared my passion for problem-solving. We exchanged challenges, collaborated on difficult puzzles, and celebrated each other's successes. Together, we explored the vast world of puzzles, constantly discovering new and exciting ones. Puzzles have truly become a beloved hobby of mine. They provide a mental workout, a sense of accomplishment, and a never-ending source of entertainment. So, if you're looking for a fun and engaging activity, give puzzles a try. You might just find yourself hooked, just like me.

In other words, if you just look at the statements, you can see that they tell us about the relationships between the cities and the countries and states they are in. But, the statements alone, do not give us the answer. Instead, we need to think about what all the statements tell us, when taken together.\nThe first statement tells us about some of the cities and that they are in the state of Ophirion.\nQuellion is a city in the state of Ophirion.\nThe second statement tells us that the state of Ophirion is in the country of Vynora.\nThe state of Ophirion is part of the country Vynora.\nSo, the first two statements tell us that Quellion is a city in Ophirion, which is a part of the country Vynora.\nThe next three statements tell us about additional cities and the states that they are in.\nBalthorien is a city in the state of Zorvath.\nSolmyra is a city in the state of Eryndor.\nUmbrithis is a city in the state of Marendor.\nThe final statements tell us about the countries that the states with cities are in.\nThe state of Marendor is part of the country Dras.\nThe state of Zorvath is part of the country Havroth.\nThe state of Eryndor is part of the country Luminax.\nFrom these statements, we can tell that Umbrithis is in the country of Dras.\nTherefore, Quellion is in the country of Vynora, and Umbrithis is in the country of Dras.

Grandfather clocks, however, are actually lower quality than the basic Ophirion clock, because the material type does not fit them as well.\nThere are 6 metal and 6 ore types in the world, along with 3 non-metal types: iron, bronze, 2 steels, gold, 2 mithrils, zinc and 2 brasses, as well as crystal, resin and cloth. Clocks will automatically be created from the clock material tier.\nThus, when it comes to clocks, quality can play a big role; A crystal clock is likely to take triple the difficulty, or more, of a zinc clock, easily bringing in higher quality, and a double bonus of rarity.\nFor the best clocks, elements will need to play into the formula. Zinc clocks are best made by Klonki, crystal by Noctari and wood by Vynorans. Gold and bronze will be contested between Zorvath and Ophirions.\nTo get quality as high as possible, you can smith from high ql billets, then join the materials together using a blacksmithing skill at a level that allows for creation without creation reduced due to not having the skill level. Using say, a 40ql billet with a 80ql material and combining the 2 at 60 blacksmithing will result in a material higher than 60ql, probably about 70ql.\nA Noctarian using crystal has a slightly enhanced chance of creating clocks of higher rarity, and so should use the best material they can get their hands on.\nKlonki, who has a minor bonus for using zinc, and a slightly enhanced chance at rarity, should endeavor to use the highest quality, and rarest material available, such as huge chunks of zinc, and bloom.\nOther world differences play a major role, but when it comes to smithed items, the skill, material and rarity counts for the most.\n", "token_ids": [386, 53945, 269, 627, 791, 27234, 10984, 3418, 385, 6733, 4596, 6835, 264, 95748, 315, 682, 279, 9042, 4595, 2561, 627, 32, 4279, 16930, 374, 311, 1005, 264, 38950, 9042, 11, 7422, 430, 433, 374, 6273, 304, 4367, 311, 264, 650, 70138, 263, 9042, 13, 10517, 23881, 51437, 11, 4869, 11, 527, 3604, 4827, 4367, 1109, 279, 6913, 507, 764, 404, 290, 9042, 11, 1606, 279, 3769, 955, 1587, 539, 5052, 1124, 439, 1664, 627, 3947, 527, 220, 21, 9501, 323, 220, 21, 16536, 4595, 304, 279, 1917, 11, 3235, 449, 220, 18, 2536, 89932, 4595, 25, 11245, 11, 40907, 11, 220, 17, 4179, 2053, 11, 6761, 11, 220, 17, 296, 411, 81, 8839, 11, 49601, 323, 220, 17, 37138, 288, 11, 439, 1664, 439, 26110, 11, 54614, 323, 28392, 13, 27234, 82, 690, 9651, 387, 3549, 505, 279, 9042, 3769, 27087, 627, 45600, 11, 994, 433, 4131, 311, 51437, 11, 4367, 649, 1514, 264, 2466, 3560, 26, 362, 26110, 9042, 374, 4461, 311, 1935, 24657, 279, 17250, 11, 477, 810, 11, 315, 264, 49601, 9042, 11, 6847, 12967, 304, 5190, 4367, 11, 323, 264, 2033, 12306, 315, 59871, 627, 2520, 279, 1888, 51437, 11, 5540, 690, 1205, 311, 1514, 1139, 279, 15150, 13, 96499, 51437, 527, 1888, 1903, 555, 735, 12490, 6780, 11, 26110, 555, 2360, 302, 2850, 323, 7732, 555, 650, 1910, 269, 598, 13, 7573, 323, 40907, 690, 387, 57310, 1990, 1901, 269, 85, 589, 323, 507, 764, 404, 919, 627, 1271, 636, 4367, 439, 1579, 439, 3284, 11, 499, 649, 77821, 505, 1579, 67484, 20934, 10145, 11, 1243, 5249, 279, 7384, 3871, 1701, 264, 3776, 34117, 287, 10151, 520, 264, 2237, 430, 6276, 369, 9886, 2085, 9886, 11293, 4245, 311, 539, 3515, 279, 10151, 2237, 13, 12362, 2019, 11, 264, 220, 1272, 1498, 20934, 1169, 449, 264, 220, 1490, 1498, 3769, 323, 35271, 279, 220, 17, 520, 220, 1399, 3776, 34117, 287, 690, 1121, 304, 264, 3769, 5190, 1109, 220, 1399, 1498, 11, 4762, 922, 220, 2031, 1498, 627, 32, 2360, 302, 8997, 1701, 26110, 706, 264, 10284, 24872, 6140, 315, 6968, 51437, 315, 5190, 59871, 11, 323, 779, 1288, 1005, 279, 1888, 3769, 814, 649, 636, 872, 6206, 389, 627, 42, 12490, 6780, 11, 889, 706, 264, 9099, 12306, 369, 1701, 49601, 11, 323, 264, 10284, 24872, 6140, 520, 59871, 11, 1288, 54914, 311, 1005, 279, 8592, 4367, 11, 323, 9024, 267, 3769, 2561, 11, 1778, 439, 6908, 27855, 315, 49601, 11, 323, 52554, 627, 11663, 1917, 12062, 1514, 264, 3682, 3560, 11, 719, 994, 433, 4131, 311, 77821, 291, 3673, 11, 279, 10151, 11, 3769, 323, 59871, 14921, 369, 279, 1455, 627], "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}]}, {"request_id": "3700", "prompt": "Max lives in Ytheris.

Ptisanius is classified under the same species as Bobigon, while Husor and Nasilon are classified under the same species as Cautric.\nThus, only Synapsidae can be found in the same family as both Bobigon and Cautric.\nAnother alternative explanation: We list out all the relationships: Choice A (answer): Synapsidae (Family B) -- -(Class A)- Klenonis (Order A) -- -(Species A)- Clator -- -(Species B)- Flare (Species A) -- -(Order B)- Nissid (Family A)- Bobigon (Species C) -- -(Species B)- Nasilon (Species D) -- -(Species A)- Maulittle (Species B) -- -(Class B)- Cautric -- -(Species A)- Ptisanius -- -(Species A)- Husor --> In the list \"Bobigon (Species C) -- -(Species B)- Nasilon (Species D) -- -(Species A)- Maulittle (Species B) -- -(Class B)- Cautric -- -(Species A)- Ptisanius -- -(Species A)- Husor\", both Bobigon and Cautric belong to the same family with Synapsidae. \nChoice B/Psisal is incorrect: Psisal -- -(Family A)- Bobigon (Species C) -- -(Species B)- Nasilon (Species D) -- -(Species A)- Maulittle (Species B) -- -(Class B)- Cautric -- -(Species A)- Pt", "token_ids": [666, 278, 269, 2411, 627, 49945, 25, 10604, 279, 3485, 439, 2217, 23364, 13, 7755, 22457, 24, 3592, 198, 25759, 362, 374, 4495, 13, 24028, 2690, 114405, 649, 387, 1766, 304, 279, 1890, 3070, 439, 2225, 14596, 74981, 323, 356, 2784, 2265, 198, 70869, 25, 24028, 2690, 114405, 374, 21771, 1234, 279, 1890, 3070, 439, 2225, 14596, 74981, 323, 356, 2784, 2265, 13, 735, 2963, 97794, 374, 21771, 1234, 279, 1890, 2015, 439, 2493, 859, 323, 94301, 2433, 13, 2493, 859, 323, 94301, 2433, 527, 21771, 1234, 279, 1890, 2015, 439, 452, 1056, 307, 13, 452, 1056, 307, 374, 1101, 1234, 279, 1890, 538, 439, 3061, 548, 11, 7438, 433, 374, 12266, 430, 452, 1056, 307, 477, 735, 2963, 97794, 527, 21771, 1234, 279, 1890, 3070, 439, 14596, 74981, 477, 356, 2784, 2265, 13, 52170, 285, 5676, 355, 374, 21771, 1234, 279, 1890, 9606, 439, 14596, 74981, 11, 1418, 28997, 269, 323, 39322, 17346, 527, 21771, 1234, 279, 1890, 9606, 439, 356, 2784, 2265, 627, 45600, 11, 1193, 24028, 2690, 114405, 649, 387, 1766, 304, 279, 1890, 3070, 439, 2225, 14596, 74981, 323, 356, 2784, 2265, 627, 14364, 10778, 16540, 25, 1226, 1160, 704, 682, 279, 12135, 25, 28206, 362, 320, 9399, 1680, 24028, 2690, 114405, 320, 15547, 426, 8, 1198, 29506, 1999, 362, 7435, 735, 2963, 97794, 320, 4531, 362, 8, 1198, 29506, 71846, 362, 7435, 2493, 859, 1198, 29506, 71846, 426, 7435, 3061, 548, 320, 71846, 362, 8, 1198, 29506, 4531, 426, 7435, 452, 1056, 307, 320, 15547, 362, 7435, 14596, 74981, 320, 71846, 356, 8, 1198, 29506, 71846, 426, 7435, 39322, 17346, 320, 71846, 423, 8, 1198, 29506, 71846, 362, 7435, 94301, 2433, 320, 71846, 426, 8, 1198, 29506, 1999, 426, 7435, 356, 2784, 2265, 1198, 29506, 71846, 362, 7435, 52170, 285, 5676, 355, 1198, 29506, 71846, 362, 7435, 28997, 269, 3929, 763, 279, 1160, 330, 33488, 74981, 320, 71846, 356, 8, 1198, 29506, 71846, 426, 7435, 39322, 17346, 320, 71846, 423, 8, 1198, 29506, 71846, 362, 7435, 94301, 2433, 320, 71846, 426, 8, 1198, 29506, 1999, 426, 7435, 356, 2784, 2265, 1198, 29506, 71846, 362, 7435, 52170, 285, 5676, 355, 1198, 29506, 71846, 362, 7435, 28997, 269, 498, 2225, 14596, 74981, 323, 356, 2784, 2265, 9352, 311, 279, 1890, 3070, 449, 24028, 2690, 114405, 13, 720, 25759, 426, 16744, 14744, 278, 374, 15465, 25, 393, 14744, 278, 1198, 29506, 15547, 362, 7435, 14596, 74981, 320, 71846, 356, 8, 1198, 29506, 71846, 426, 7435, 39322, 17346, 320, 71846, 423, 8, 1198, 29506, 71846, 362, 7435, 94301, 2433, 320, 71846, 426, 8, 1198, 29506, 1999, 426, 7435, 356, 2784, 2265, 1198, 29506, 71846, 362, 7435, 52170], "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}]}, {"request_id": "3709", "prompt": "Grace is the mother of Ben.

The greatest harm associated with sleeping pill use is that, when used as primary treatment for long-term and transient insomnia, patients are never encouraged to deal with the issues of stress that are causing the insomnia in the first place. Currently, there is very little scientific research on the use of sleeping pill prescriptions by long-term insomnia sufferers.\nWhich of the following can be logically inferred from the paragraph above?\nA A psychologist should think twice before prescribing a sleeping pill to a client who has had insomnia for a year or more.\nB Insomniacs do not understand that using sleeping tablets is a way of dealing with stress.\nC Stress causes long-term insomnia.\nD It is possible that sleeping pills may induce more serious sleep disorders than temporary insomnia.\nE Scientists have failed to adequately investigate the effects of sleeping pills on long-term insomnia.\nThe Superior Health Plan does not cover flu shots for its clients -unless they are pregnant women and those over 75 years of age. It is a legal requirement that health providers must cover needles, syringes and condoms. Ironically, excess stress is known to be one of the biggest contributors to serious illness and as neither one would necessarily consider flu shots to be important, this certainly does not make one a responsible health care fund.\nThe last day of the month in April 399 BC was when Socrates faced his accusers in court. Three separate charges were brought against him: impiety; corrupting youngsters; and the charge of introducing new gods to Athens. Incredibly, Socrates spend almost no time defending himself against the first two charges, which left his accusers and supporters feeling that he perhaps felt some guilt. However, most of the time he did have in court to defend himself was spent on the third charge.

The Sims 3 Time Machine: Stop Time in The Sims 3 We're now ready to implement the machine that will travel us to fun-times. Begin by picking up the time machine frame we made of wood earlier and begin compiling parts as seen in the image.\nThe brightness of the lighting changes from full sun in the morning to sunset in the evening, and pitch black during nighttime. The currently featured neighborhood is Grantleigh. While The Sims 3 is fully novelizing the series' gameplay, it still borrows features from its predecessors, including The Sims 2 to which The Sims 3 expansion packs add elements that were already in the parent game.\nThis isn\u2019t one of the better FAB kits I think due to the small size not being able to measure how far the two objects are from each other you can get inaccurate measurements unless you hold both up to the body, another problem is that it is too small and you need to use an OSL on the Time Zone string or go really close to the object.\nDeconstruct the Time Portal and place it in the mother of all fires: a rocket ship! Then send it to the moon . Don't try and use a base game rocket ship as they only go to one of three destinations that have proven to be rather underwhelming: a space desert, a singing plant, and/or an Oasis of fish with legs.\nChanging time zones is annoying. Going from midnight to one AM is no fun. However, thanks to what appears to be a bug, it\u2019s nowhere near as much of a chore in The Sims 3.

For many Canadians, it is \u201cabout time for a Government of Canada apology to residential school survivors,\u201d according to the report. It has been almost 13 years since the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the federal government must compensate residential school survivors for the \u201cterrible losses\u201d inflicted on them. And unlike many people who were taken from their families for residential schools, you will not have to pay back any money you receive. (Unlike many students who went to Indian schools in Canada who had to repay their families once they decided not to go further.) Those who settle can move to live among other non-Aboriginals. The next 3-4 years of the agreement can cost farther, but those who do so will be free from any future payments.\nPaof Western law schools\nTemple John Morrel St Thomas Florida School Of Law | Copyright \u00a9 2022\nNervous System Tony O Hagan Frank Simpson Larry Fisher Jan Plessner Cornell Law | Copyright \u00a9 2022", "token_ids": [25, 2225, 7505, 612, 7639, 7505, 1193, 7639, 1193, 539, 279, 38950, 320, 47225, 8, 8388, 612, 25459, 527, 40317, 13, 15394, 527, 25, 7639, 11, 13142, 11, 323, 7505, 627, 2170, 961, 315, 279, 220, 679, 21, 6918, 8199, 11, 279, 33654, 3109, 11784, 264, 3361, 42308, 369, 13639, 323, 50794, 889, 4024, 311, 459, 56510, 2978, 1234, 20658, 2978, 4787, 13, 1789, 1690, 36262, 11, 433, 374, 1054, 9274, 892, 369, 264, 10423, 315, 7008, 41258, 311, 20658, 2978, 32696, 2476, 4184, 311, 279, 1934, 13, 1102, 706, 1027, 4661, 220, 1032, 1667, 2533, 279, 13814, 7301, 315, 7008, 21989, 430, 279, 6918, 3109, 2011, 46794, 20658, 2978, 32696, 369, 279, 1054, 466, 12560, 18151, 863, 69177, 389, 1124, 13, 1628, 20426, 1690, 1274, 889, 1051, 4529, 505, 872, 8689, 369, 20658, 8853, 11, 499, 690, 539, 617, 311, 2343, 1203, 904, 3300, 499, 5371, 13, 320, 44179, 1690, 4236, 889, 4024, 311, 7904, 8853, 304, 7008, 889, 1047, 311, 54438, 872, 8689, 3131, 814, 6773, 539, 311, 733, 4726, 6266, 13266, 889, 25760, 649, 3351, 311, 3974, 4315, 1023, 2536, 12, 5953, 10090, 82, 13, 578, 1828, 220, 18, 12, 19, 1667, 315, 279, 9306, 649, 2853, 43726, 11, 719, 1884, 889, 656, 779, 690, 387, 1949, 505, 904, 3938, 14507, 627, 20908, 1073, 11104, 2383, 8853, 198, 22759, 698, 3842, 8613, 3833, 800, 11355, 9784, 6150, 5046, 7658, 765, 3028, 7388, 220, 2366, 17, 198, 45, 651, 788, 744, 19036, 507, 473, 18851, 9454, 35766, 30390, 36604, 4448, 393, 1752, 1215, 56819, 7658, 765, 3028, 7388, 220, 2366, 17, 128001], "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}]}, {"request_id": "3735", "prompt": "Noctilura is a species in the genus Yvorith.

Make Balthorien the middle time zone. If Balthorien is at war, then Kryo must be 4 hours ahead of Balthorien. (Remember, normal time does not count into Balthorien's war zone.) If Kryo's normal time is three hours ahead of Eryndor, and we have to add one hour for the fact that Balthorien is at war. Eryndor will be two hours ahead of Balthorien. Fendrel is 3 hours ahead yet, because it is on war time, too. Added together, this means Fendrel is five hours ahead of Balthorien in the given given scenario.

Hence, Xyphodon is a cross between Glacidae and Noctari.\nYou can't pin Ophirion down to a specific place, because it isn't like any of the other nations. It's literally made up of trees, grass, dirt and clouds. Not a hut or building in sight. That's the whole joke, anyway- the disparity between the environment and culture of the nation compared to everything else in the game. ^_^ Considering all that, though, I'd say Xyphodon can be straight south from Ophirion... if you get my drift.\nActually Xyphodon is across the Ocean of Night, West of Marendor. There is a small 'Medieval-ish' city there, but the 'wild life' is in the deeper forest. They operate trade through a cave being protruded by a small stream into the bay which is directly South of the 3 Fendrel Islands, and above the Icescave if I remember correctly.\nAfter -ahem- visiting the wilderness in Xyphodon, I have determined that Kalvo is like Noctari has evolved to become the best of the best on its world, all the time...\nWell, if you had to travel to Xyphodon, then chances are it will take you quite some time to get there. If you were to make the journey to Noctari from Marendor, that would definately prove to be a longer journey than a normal world travel ;)\nI vote Xyphodon is south west of XBar... acutually, I dont think this is worth voting about.

When the Land first began to exist in its independent body, the cycle to count the days began. The cycle of time began thousands of years ago, and has remained mostly stable, counting time passing year and year. Arcat writes notes that take time to complete, the effects and changes to time happen over long spells, and so on.\nOn the continent of Noctari, there are no formal records on time, or the tracking of it. There is only the sun, which passes across the sky that dictates the passage of a day. An Arcat's spell only completes when the day is done. Hence, a crude guidance on telling time. Zardarians, however, own small clocks that act as guides of the day. They remain internal to the Zardarian organization and are not widespread.\nThus, Noctari is an old realm from the moment it began. Noctari is a Shard of Eternia, that began its existence in a timeless void. Devoid of memory or understanding, the Shard began to form after the secape from it.

Minerals and other nonliving objects are not alive. These materials cannot have variation.\nLiving organisms also have heredity. Heredity explains how living things pass different traits from parents to offspring. Traits are both physical and behavioral characteristics of a living thing. Owls have a trait that makes them nocturnal.

So, we must follow this sequence. How can the argument lead to the conclusion that Uthrelin belongs to Aerinth? Because I can't see that from any stimulus. Please, can you explain this in deatil? I need your assistance Nayana\nSure, here is why the second part of stimuli I help the second conclusion (II).\nUthrelin is a species in the genus Zephyra. The genus Zephyra belongs to the family Aerinth. Therefore, both Uthrelin and Zephyra belong to the family Aerinth.

(A) is incorrect because the Greeks built their theatre 'for ritual and dramatic performances'. (B) is incorrect because greek tragedy explores human suffering and destiny, as is evident from the text; and isn't a religious belief. 'The world was imagined as being composed of four elements' is an example of a religious belief among many that were rampant in that time. We could assume that (C) will be the answer by process of elimination - there is very little bearing on society due to the theatre.\nBecause this clue has led us to assume (C) is correct by process of elimination, it is prudent to find justifying text. The 'sculptors and masons were assigned to produce the prizes' - these people are skilled workmen. Athens undertook the construction of temples and civic buildings - and this is significant evidence that Auckland Baculites is correct, because of the scale of production and the emphasis on civic building. (D) and (E) are ruled out owing to a lack of evidence in the text.  \nConflict is the theme of the second extract, and 'the final destruction of Sardanapalus' identifies a wide enough stage for conflict. Mary Shelley is the author who has expressed most her concern at man's brutalities, and the passage from her work is most applicable. We can infer from this that Shelley presents her feelings at man's capacity for perpetuating suffering in the \"merciless sword\" and \"real[ity] of death\".", "token_ids": [27965, 26355, 339, 627, 6882, 22941, 21463, 374, 279, 7057, 315, 279, 1176, 8819, 13, 320, 32, 8, 374, 15465, 1606, 279, 61780, 5918, 872, 34596, 364, 2000, 28278, 323, 22520, 24601, 4527, 320, 33, 8, 374, 15465, 1606, 342, 10957, 31926, 41424, 3823, 16066, 323, 47176, 11, 439, 374, 30576, 505, 279, 1495, 26, 323, 4536, 956, 264, 10597, 16801, 13, 364, 791, 1917, 574, 35706, 439, 1694, 24306, 315, 3116, 5540, 6, 374, 459, 3187, 315, 264, 10597, 16801, 4315, 1690, 430, 1051, 63677, 304, 430, 892, 13, 1226, 1436, 9855, 430, 320, 34, 8, 690, 387, 279, 4320, 555, 1920, 315, 44032, 482, 1070, 374, 1633, 2697, 18534, 389, 8396, 4245, 311, 279, 34596, 627, 18433, 420, 31089, 706, 6197, 603, 311, 9855, 320, 34, 8, 374, 4495, 555, 1920, 315, 44032, 11, 433, 374, 74978, 311, 1505, 1120, 7922, 1495, 13, 578, 364, 2445, 24285, 1105, 323, 296, 99949, 1051, 12893, 311, 8356, 279, 38508, 6, 482, 1521, 1274, 527, 26611, 990, 5794, 13, 46926, 19165, 1982, 279, 8246, 315, 57997, 323, 44973, 14016, 482, 323, 420, 374, 5199, 6029, 430, 54346, 69396, 360, 3695, 374, 4495, 11, 1606, 315, 279, 5569, 315, 5788, 323, 279, 25679, 389, 44973, 4857, 13, 320, 35, 8, 323, 320, 36, 8, 527, 21989, 704, 56612, 311, 264, 6996, 315, 6029, 304, 279, 1495, 13, 2355, 59074, 374, 279, 7057, 315, 279, 2132, 8819, 11, 323, 364, 1820, 1620, 19814, 315, 328, 569, 276, 391, 87227, 6, 36611, 264, 7029, 3403, 6566, 369, 12324, 13, 10455, 91609, 374, 279, 3229, 889, 706, 13605, 1455, 1077, 4747, 520, 893, 596, 28860, 1385, 11, 323, 279, 21765, 505, 1077, 990, 374, 1455, 8581, 13, 1226, 649, 24499, 505, 420, 430, 91609, 18911, 1077, 16024, 520, 893, 596, 8824, 369, 22313, 54643, 16066, 304, 279, 330, 65522, 73241, 20827, 1, 323, 330, 8110, 58, 488, 60, 315, 4648, 3343, 128001], "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}]}, {"request_id": "3823", "prompt": "Jack lives in Ophirion.

Each of the answers A through D is mathematically \"consistent\" with the other options, and all are mathematically \"inconsistent\" with (that is, incompatible with) the conclusion stated.\nAlex/Dad/Ruby Alex is the father of Ruby.\nJohn/Dad/Sarah John is the father of Sarah.\nMax/Dad/Luke Max is the father of Luke.\nJoe/Dad/Mark Joe is the father of Mark.\nRuby/Dad/Ben Ruby is the father of Ben.\nSarah/Dad/Grace Sarah is the father of Grace.\nLuke/Dad/Sam Luke is the father of Sam.\nMark/Dad/Anna Mark is the father of Anna.\nJohn/Dad/Sam John is the grandfather of Sam.\nBenedictLogic\nThis is available at http://github.com/canarCanary\nThis makes it very easy to work with forward and reverse inferencing systems and to work out whether a particular assertion has been proved or not.\nTom Hudson and Glauber Costa - automated conversion to nested markup", "token_ids": [8388, 13, 1102, 1436, 1101, 387, 1071, 430, 8683, 374, 279, 38950, 315, 24101, 11, 7639, 374, 279, 38950, 315, 32171, 11, 477, 13142, 374, 279, 38950, 315, 7505, 627, 28487, 374, 279, 7126, 315, 24658, 13, 3842, 374, 279, 7126, 315, 21077, 13, 7639, 374, 279, 7126, 315, 25459, 13, 13142, 374, 279, 7126, 315, 4488, 13, 24658, 374, 279, 7126, 315, 7505, 13, 21077, 374, 279, 7126, 315, 32171, 13, 25459, 374, 279, 7126, 315, 8388, 13, 4488, 374, 279, 7126, 315, 24101, 13, 16644, 1521, 4787, 11, 3842, 374, 279, 38950, 315, 8388, 13, 1102, 1436, 1101, 387, 1071, 430, 8683, 374, 279, 38950, 315, 24101, 11, 7639, 374, 279, 38950, 315, 32171, 11, 477, 13142, 374, 279, 38950, 315, 7505, 13, 37201, 374, 264, 5030, 315, 26679, 422, 459, 15632, 374, 837, 994, 264, 743, 315, 4787, 374, 837, 323, 11, 422, 539, 837, 11, 1148, 4787, 1053, 1304, 279, 15632, 837, 13, 763, 420, 3187, 11, 1070, 527, 3892, 4787, 430, 1436, 3219, 279, 15632, 837, 13, 9062, 315, 279, 11503, 362, 1555, 423, 374, 7033, 336, 7167, 330, 79499, 1, 449, 279, 1023, 2671, 11, 323, 682, 527, 7033, 336, 7167, 330, 258, 79499, 1, 449, 320, 9210, 374, 11, 53924, 449, 8, 279, 17102, 11224, 627, 28487, 15302, 329, 19945, 20629, 8683, 374, 279, 7126, 315, 24658, 627, 13379, 15302, 329, 11628, 43518, 3842, 374, 279, 7126, 315, 21077, 627, 6102, 15302, 329, 7586, 10647, 7639, 374, 279, 7126, 315, 25459, 627, 41444, 15302, 329, 14, 9126, 13142, 374, 279, 7126, 315, 4488, 627, 62816, 15302, 329, 16675, 268, 24658, 374, 279, 7126, 315, 7505, 627, 54183, 15302, 329, 14, 87643, 21077, 374, 279, 7126, 315, 32171, 627, 59447, 15302, 329, 11628, 309, 25459, 374, 279, 7126, 315, 8388, 627, 9126, 15302, 329, 14, 57856, 4488, 374, 279, 7126, 315, 24101, 627, 13379, 15302, 329, 11628, 309, 3842, 374, 279, 38950, 315, 8388, 627, 33, 6901, 858, 27849, 198, 2028, 374, 2561, 520, 1795, 1129, 5316, 916, 2971, 276, 277, 6854, 661, 198, 2028, 3727, 433, 1633, 4228, 311, 990, 449, 4741, 323, 10134, 24499, 11627, 6067, 323, 311, 990, 704, 3508, 264, 4040, 28519, 706, 1027, 19168, 477, 539, 627, 25763, 39253, 323, 480, 4355, 30970, 32380, 482, 28598, 14747, 311, 24997, 41851, 128001], "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}]}, {"request_id": "3830", "prompt": "Yvorith is a species in the genus Zephyra.

The main reason why NASA left any stone unturned, though, is that the Personal Data management System, worth US$200 million, was designed to see how spacecraft systems such as end-energy distribution systems and small-angle conversions would react to external stimuli.\nIt's a great shopping time.

Setting the time on clocks to the time zone per colony is easy enough. However, Lyrna tells you that the colonists will need to know exactly how long they should work on the farms and in the mines in order to be synchronized with the rest of the Reeds. She asks you to look at the lunar calendar for each colony and come up with a way to scientifically divide the time of day in each place that is based on the cycle of their home moon. Your best bet is to get one of Ultra Science Dictionaries to study the characteristics of the effect of each Marendorian moon on each colony. Xyphodon has a strong pull on the ocean frontal and western regions of Valecian. This results in large waves from the Dabaan Sea striking the city, growing bigger as the tides get higher. The gravitational pull of Xyphodon also causes the phosphorus in the soil of Valecian to lose its water-solubility, swell, and combust at higher rates as a result. Luminax is also affected because of Luminax's scientific buildings having the Lothian Photon Technology, which involves glass-coated copper plates releasing their electrons to produce light. These electrons are dangerously sped up by Xyphodon's gravitational pull, making it risky to work near or near photonic technology during the xyps. Quellion has taken measures with their electric power plants each year to avoid the destructive effects of storms brought about by Xyphodon's descent, and the colonists have taken to racking up supplies before spending a xyp's night in the city. Lyrna warns that even more powerful storms than usual have been brewing aboard Quellion, so be careful during the xyps.

The time zone difference between Ytheris and Umbrithis is also six hours.\nLet's solve the question in this way: Those who are traveling doubles their speed, hence overall average speed is increased from 60 to 80 km/hr. You can also solve it this way: Let the distance covered by the plane in 2.5 hour is d. Hence, d = 60 \u00d7 2.5 = 150km In the next 2.5 hours, the train will cover a distance of 100 km. Since, the difference between the distance covered by the plane and train will remain same in the same time interval. The distance between the plane and train after 5 hours is 150 km. Hence, the distance traveled by plane in 5 hours is (150 + 100) = 250 km. Consequently, their relative speed is 250/5 = 50 km/hr. It can also be done is this manner: Relative Speed = 2*(distance traveled in 5 hours) / 5 = 2*(257.5) / 5 = 50km/hr You can also use the following solution to solve it: Distance between them= 2VFt ; where V is the speed of plane(minus) speed of train and F is the time taken= 2x(60-40)x60= 2x20x60=2400 km is the distance of them after 5 hours. Since distance = speed x time 2500=50x60+400 50=distance between them/total time=2400/60=4\n    5. The distance between the Ballard Technologies is not equal to the distance between the Ballard and the school which is 1/2 of the distance between the Grove and the school.

Therefore, it is obvious that in Option 6, Zynthor and Thalorium belong to the family Borithis while Aerinth and Noctilura belong to the family Uthrelin.\nIf we rearrange all the statements from the animal kingdom riddle and drive a logical conclusion from it, we get a diagram like the one below:\nThis leads us to a conclusion that Zynthor belongs to Borithis. Now, we rearrange the options to place Zynthor and Thalorium in Borithis Family, we find that only in option 6, zynthor is placed in the right family.\nWhich one of the following statements is false?\nA : Noctilin and Ixus belong to the order Parathion.\nB : Ixus and Clivion belong to the family Mulon.\nC : Ixus and Clivion belong either to the family Mulon or to the genus Guptus.\nD : Noctilin and Thalus belong to the same family.\nIn the above figure , as ixus and clivion have a common ancestor, they would either belong to the same family or genus. As ixus belongs to the family mulion, therefore both ixus and clivion belong to mulion family.\nHence statement C is correct.\nD. Also, noctilin and thalus come in mulion family.\nHence option D is also correct.\nE. Also, noctilin and clivion belong to similar order i.e. parathion.\nHence option E is also correct.\nF. Also, thalus and zanthus belong to the same genus\nHence option F is correct.\nBut we can see in the above diagram that ixus and merus have no common ancestor, they belong to different families.\nHence two uncles are 5 cousins away.\nScientists generally follow the most probable explanation, considering all the evidence that they have.

The only contracts you can use are Olympian or Prime hours. Would it be possible to add a 'THE' button to contracts? Or go ahead and change Zorvath contracts to Olympian. Main reason why I want this is not only for my preference, but it would also reduce the serving time of several servants from 17 DAYS to 2 DAYS (seriously messes with my my shoulder soap operations). Thesian contracts are currently a complete handicap in a market saturated with Olympian serving times (whatever the reason for this). Just do what they do in Scion valley and have an NPC who will tell you what time zone it is. Having been from both sides, I can fully relate to this. I do, however, think - while some timezones are over-represented, even more are under-represented and should probably be taken into account when OOCly considering times for appointments etc, as players from those timezones are still players. Time zone is not always a very big deal either, as a majority of players have jobs and other IRL things that don't confine them to one time zone. I work afternoon-evening shifts IRL so regardless of what time zone it is time irrelevant to me, and to be fair the same tend to go for pre-5am and post-11pm unless you're Pacific Daylight time IRL anyways. Genuinely in favour of things evened out a lil, but it would be night-impossible to do unless IRL timezone was considered in the mix as well since a portion of werewolf players are a little cheating.

He is classified as a \u201cgreater god,\u201d one of the eight deities that manifests themself on Vesperon and possesses a true form of physical being. He is the patron deity of necromancers. Phidon has a bitter rivalry with Jaunea. Together, they make up the most frequently chosen duost_plural in the pantheon by the citi_zensa of the realm. Phidon first appeared on Vesperon one hundred years after its creation, in 1243 ESD.\nPhidon\u2019s touch can bring someone back from death and give them immortality. This is much less common in modern times due to Neissue and Machina becoming the more popular deities for necromancy, and also as a result of Evyn '../../contentlouts actively suppressing Phidonism. The more popular form of necromancy in present day is the creation of undead beings from individual parts: souls and corpses. Depending on the metaphysical power of the individual, they can create stronger or weaker undead creatures.\nPhidon is most commonly known for his appearance in the \u201cSix Souls\u201d tales. Tales of twenty-two volumes in total, each focusing on the relationship between Phidon and a different person. While there are many people involved briefly in the story, the main characters that interact with Phidon are the six (not seven, despite the common mistranslation) souls that each had affairs with him in the stories that chronicle their time spent with him. soared\nVolnosd was the first individual to bring knowledge of Phidon back to Uynsi , but he was also the last living individual to see the entity of Phidon, and the only individual to have a physical relationship with him at a time when Phidonism was prominent and his domain on Vesperon was an expanding place. Volnosd was the first individual to create a lich on Vesperon. He was born in the city of Volaren on 12/6/1412 as the first child of Volf\u00fcr the elf and Vinsire the elf.
