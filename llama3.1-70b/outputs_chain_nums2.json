They shouldn\u2019t have done this. That\u2019s how to break the cryptic code. So for the rest of this page, we\u2019re going to break the code.\n\u2018Glacidae is three hours ahead of Zorvath. And the combined 3 hours gives us 6 hours. So Glacidae is six hours ahead of Havroth. Zorvath is three hours ahead of Havroth. Xyphodon is three hours ahead of Solmyra. So Zorvath and the Northern Territory of Planet Hulk are nine hours ahead of Xyphodon. So that means Xyphodon is nine hours behind Zorvath.\u2019\nThat\u2019s how we break the most", "token_ids": [1901, 269, 85, 589, 13, 328, 5876, 4592, 53, 4013, 5828, 1431, 3831, 3403, 311, 1464, 1475, 14774, 292, 2082, 13, 3161, 1884, 5435, 11, 279, 2082, 374, 6724, 11102, 13, 4452, 11, 422, 264, 502, 1376, 315, 14774, 292, 2082, 374, 7263, 709, 11, 1109, 279, 11841, 315, 1556, 72, 318, 3035, 1053, 387, 304, 264, 2766, 315, 12544, 13, 10926, 433, 753, 264, 2766, 2288, 45207, 430, 279, 6783, 315, 2999, 300, 11263, 279, 2999, 300, 35057, 11, 902, 374, 2204, 311, 430, 315, 279, 6783, 315, 8444, 582, 114405, 13, 2999, 300, 4869, 11263, 1630, 88, 764, 77152, 753, 35057, 13, 2435, 13434, 1431, 617, 2884, 420, 13, 3011, 753, 1268, 311, 1464, 279, 14774, 292, 2082, 13, 2100, 369, 279, 2800, 315, 420, 2199, 11, 584, 3207, 2133, 311, 1464, 279, 2082, 627, 14336, 32641, 582, 114405, 374, 2380, 4207, 8469, 315, 1901, 269, 85, 589, 13, 1628, 279, 11093, 220, 18, 4207, 6835, 603, 220, 21, 4207, 13, 2100, 8444, 582, 114405, 374, 4848, 4207, 8469, 315, 56208, 299, 339, 13, 1901, 269, 85, 589, 374, 2380, 4207, 8469, 315, 56208, 299, 339, 13, 1630, 88, 764, 77152, 374, 2380, 4207, 8469, 315, 11730, 2465, 969, 13, 2100, 1901, 269, 85, 589, 323, 279, 17355, 49187, 315, 29935, 61946, 527, 11888, 4207, 8469, 315, 1630, 88, 764, 77152, 13, 2100, 430, 3445, 1630, 88, 764, 77152, 374, 11888, 4207, 4920, 1901, 269, 85, 589, 14639, 198, 4897, 753, 1268, 584, 1464, 279, 1455], "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}]}, {"request_id": "1083", "prompt": "Vynora is a city in the state of Tyseria.

These needs include sunlight, air, room, water, and nutrients. These nutrients come from air, water, and soil. Plants also need warmth.\nSunlight is important for a plant's growth. Plants need sunlight for photosynthesis, or the process of making their food. In photosynthesis, plants take in carbon dioxide, water, and light energy. They use the carbon dioxide, water, and light energy to make food. As shown in the diagram below, a plant uses its leaves to take in light energy from the sun. It uses the pores on its leaves to take in carbon dioxide from the air. It takes in water and nutrients from the soil through its roots. Photosynthesis happens inside the plant's cells.

They are different species.\nB. They belong in different families.\nC. They inhabit different continents.\nAnswer: B\nExplanation: Classification systems help us to differentiate between the different types of living organisms in the world. These different organisms need to be studied, categorised and named. This makes it easier for scientists to talk about them.\nClassification systems begin with kingdoms; these are further divided into smaller and smaller groups. Each level is called a taxon. A taxon may also be called a taxonomic unit or taxonomic group.\nThe more specific the group, the fewer types of living things there are. A common term at a more detailed level will have fewer organisms that belong to it.\nFor example, the cat taxon, Felis catus, is far more specific and has fewer organisms that belong to it than the mammal taxon, Mammalia, which contains all the animals that belong to the cat taxon as well as all other mammals.\nKingdom | Animalia | the animal kingdom\nPhylum | Chordata | animals with a backbone\nOrder | Carnivora | meat eaters", "token_ids": [2405, 269, 85, 1122, 627, 28055, 279, 21765, 11, 3249, 527, 8444, 582, 114405, 323, 921, 894, 19776, 953, 21771, 26214, 5380, 32, 13, 2435, 527, 2204, 9606, 627, 33, 13, 2435, 9352, 304, 2204, 8689, 627, 34, 13, 2435, 33427, 2204, 66959, 627, 16533, 25, 426, 198, 70869, 25, 55982, 6067, 1520, 603, 311, 54263, 1990, 279, 2204, 4595, 315, 5496, 44304, 304, 279, 1917, 13, 4314, 2204, 44304, 1205, 311, 387, 20041, 11, 22824, 4147, 323, 7086, 13, 1115, 3727, 433, 8831, 369, 14248, 311, 3137, 922, 1124, 627, 86140, 6067, 3240, 449, 96506, 26, 1521, 527, 4726, 18255, 1139, 9333, 323, 9333, 5315, 13, 9062, 2237, 374, 2663, 264, 3827, 263, 13, 362, 3827, 263, 1253, 1101, 387, 2663, 264, 3827, 48228, 5089, 477, 3827, 48228, 1912, 627, 791, 810, 3230, 279, 1912, 11, 279, 17162, 4595, 315, 5496, 2574, 1070, 527, 13, 362, 4279, 4751, 520, 264, 810, 11944, 2237, 690, 617, 17162, 44304, 430, 9352, 311, 433, 627, 2520, 3187, 11, 279, 8415, 3827, 263, 11, 27246, 285, 272, 1015, 11, 374, 3117, 810, 3230, 323, 706, 17162, 44304, 430, 9352, 311, 433, 1109, 279, 36041, 278, 3827, 263, 11, 386, 8836, 19379, 11, 902, 5727, 682, 279, 10099, 430, 9352, 311, 279, 8415, 3827, 263, 439, 1664, 439, 682, 1023, 56669, 627, 34655, 5717, 765, 109383, 765, 279, 10065, 26135, 198, 3438, 28433, 765, 921, 541, 460, 765, 10099, 449, 264, 56527, 198, 4531, 765, 32749, 344, 6347, 765, 13339, 8343, 388], "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}]}, {"request_id": "1213", "prompt": "Dras is a city in the state of Marendor.

If you can find two \"arrows\" that connect to form a \"bridge,\" the answer is yes.\nIn this example, you cannot find the last piece. This means that the correct answer is choice (c).

We see that species in the Dranthidae genus are classified in the family Noctilura, while the Yvorith species are classified in the Chrysalix family.\nThen, our third premise tells us that the Fluxilus species is in the Dranthidae genus. Next, we need to consider our conclusion.\nThis conclusion makes a very bold statement: namely, it claims that the Fluxilus species is wholly classified under a different family than the Eldrinth species.

All organisms in a genus share the same genus name. Organisms in the same genus are similar, but they are different in some ways.\nOrganisms are classified into groups based on how they are related to each other. Scientists regularly change classifications based on new information about how organisms are related. Classification shows the most general group that organisms are classified into. More specific groups fall under general groups. For example, all organisms that have a backbone fall into the general Vertebrate group. The thermostatfish is a Vertebrate, and Vertebrate is the most general group that the thermostatfish is classified into.\nThe Vertebrate group is highlighted to show that it is the most general group that the thermostatfish is classified into.

You're also told that if species have similar traits, then they are classified in the same family.\nBorithis is a species in the genus Aerinth.

Humans aren't logical in all respects, but that doesn't mean one should give up on building AI or stop teaching logic, it just means humans are more context-sensitive too.\n2.

The evolutionary relationships between species are often represented using a small number of ancestral species. There are many algorithms that, taking as input the distance matrix between sequences, attempt to reconstruct the evolutionary process that gave rise to the sequence data for each species. While these methods are often probabilistic at their core, the underlying assumption is that the distances between every pair of sequences correspond to a combination of independently sampled distances. However, this results in a statistical procedure that is purely generative, is not inherently less disruptive to other species relationships, and does not fully appreciate the value of observed relative distances between clusters of species.\nWe propose a constructive approach, where the observed relative distances between clusters of species are directly encoded into a multi-layer Set Cover problem.

Could the information that is taken for granted be the source of the argument's weakness? Look for a flaw in the argument by identifying the argument's assumption or by But-ing the argument (asking \"What if this part is wrong...?\").\nLaura lives in Quellion.

Noctilura\nB. Chrysalix\nC. Dranthidae\nAnswer: A\nExplanation: In science, classification is a way to group, name, and organize things by their similarities and differences. Scientists use a binomial nomenclature, or scientific naming, system to classify organisms.\nScientists base this system on a hierarchical arrangement of taxa, or categories:\nDomain and kingdom are general categories that describe the broadest level of similarity and the most basic characteristics. As scientists classify things more specifically, they use the lower-level taxa.\nEach organism is given an individual domain, kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species name. The organism's genus and species names make up its scientific name, or binomial name.\nAs you go through the taxa, from domain and kingdom to genus and species, there are fewer differences within each group, and the common features are more specific.\nScientists practice binomial nomenclature by using an organism's genus and species. Saguinus midas is the scientific name for the midas tamarin.\nIn the binomial name Saguinus midas, Saguinus is the genus name and midas is the species name.\nTo", "token_ids": [512, 32, 13, 2360, 302, 321, 5808, 198, 33, 13, 921, 894, 19776, 953, 198, 34, 13, 2999, 32329, 114405, 198, 16533, 25, 362, 198, 70869, 25, 763, 8198, 11, 24790, 374, 264, 1648, 311, 1912, 11, 836, 11, 323, 31335, 2574, 555, 872, 43874, 323, 12062, 13, 57116, 1005, 264, 9736, 21524, 308, 89947, 1598, 11, 477, 12624, 36048, 11, 1887, 311, 49229, 44304, 627, 72326, 2385, 420, 1887, 389, 264, 70994, 27204, 315, 77314, 11, 477, 11306, 512, 13950, 323, 26135, 527, 4689, 11306, 430, 7664, 279, 7353, 478, 2237, 315, 38723, 323, 279, 1455, 6913, 17910, 13, 1666, 14248, 49229, 2574, 810, 11951, 11, 814, 1005, 279, 4827, 11852, 77314, 627, 4959, 47120, 374, 2728, 459, 3927, 8106, 11, 26135, 11, 1343, 28433, 11, 538, 11, 2015, 11, 3070, 11, 64677, 11, 323, 9606, 836, 13, 578, 47120, 596, 64677, 323, 9606, 5144, 1304, 709, 1202, 12624, 836, 11, 477, 9736, 21524, 836, 627, 2170, 499, 733, 1555, 279, 77314, 11, 505, 8106, 323, 26135, 311, 64677, 323, 9606, 11, 1070, 527, 17162, 12062, 2949, 1855, 1912, 11, 323, 279, 4279, 4519, 527, 810, 3230, 627, 72326, 6725, 9736, 21524, 308, 89947, 1598, 555, 1701, 459, 47120, 596, 64677, 323, 9606, 13, 328, 47820, 71956, 5209, 300, 374, 279, 12624, 836, 369, 279, 5209, 300, 259, 31138, 627, 644, 279, 9736, 21524, 836, 328, 47820, 71956, 5209, 300, 11, 328, 47820, 71956, 374, 279, 64677, 836, 323, 5209, 300, 374, 279, 9606, 836, 627, 1271], "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}]}, {"request_id": "1360", "prompt": "Umbrithis is a city in the state of Glacidae.

Hence, Ostira is neither the capital of Vynora nor is it the capital of Marval (since Marval is the capital of Vynora and not a state or city).\nWhether the algebraic expression 5a,a from 6 is meaningful or not depends solely on the algebraic expression.\nPremise b: Statement a, after replacement of all occurrences of each algebraic expression by the corresponding expressions given in Premise a, becomes equivalent to the algebraic expression c.\nAlgebraic expression 5x+6 and x-5x x from 2", "token_ids": [650, 1910, 6347, 20444, 650, 70138, 263, 374, 7559, 304, 14221, 805, 689, 627, 32, 15790, 276, 374, 279, 6864, 315, 56208, 299, 339, 13, 66535, 9008, 374, 279, 6864, 315, 650, 70138, 263, 13, 26232, 699, 2453, 374, 279, 6864, 315, 1630, 88, 764, 77152, 13, 13416, 16960, 374, 279, 6864, 315, 11730, 2465, 969, 13, 2947, 838, 374, 279, 6864, 315, 650, 1910, 6347, 13, 350, 2836, 88, 13915, 374, 279, 6864, 315, 14221, 805, 689, 13, 32140, 279, 39006, 649, 387, 14454, 439, 11263, 25, 362, 15790, 276, 28, 39, 402, 299, 339, 8367, 55, 88, 764, 77152, 8367, 53, 1910, 6347, 320, 11536, 56208, 299, 339, 374, 304, 650, 1910, 6347, 8, 323, 66535, 9008, 8367, 53, 70138, 263, 8367, 49912, 2465, 969, 8367, 32974, 805, 689, 13, 32140, 11, 66535, 9008, 374, 14188, 279, 6864, 315, 650, 1910, 6347, 6463, 374, 433, 279, 6864, 315, 2947, 838, 320, 11536, 2947, 838, 374, 279, 6864, 315, 650, 1910, 6347, 323, 539, 264, 1614, 477, 3363, 4390, 25729, 279, 47976, 292, 7645, 220, 20, 64, 15362, 505, 220, 21, 374, 23222, 477, 539, 14117, 21742, 389, 279, 47976, 292, 7645, 627, 42562, 1082, 293, 25, 22504, 264, 11, 1306, 14039, 315, 682, 57115, 315, 1855, 47976, 292, 7645, 555, 279, 12435, 24282, 2728, 304, 12029, 1082, 264, 11, 9221, 13890, 311, 279, 47976, 292, 7645, 272, 627, 2149, 27175, 292, 7645, 220, 20, 87, 10, 21, 323, 865, 12, 20, 87, 865, 505, 220, 17], "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}]}, {"request_id": "1470", "prompt": "Joe is the mother of Max.

Individuals of a species can mate with each other, but not with individuals of a different species. A species is given a single name with two terms, and it is called a binomial name. The first word of the name is the genus. The second word is called the specific epithet. Both the genus and the specific epithet are written in italics. Here's an example:\nArnolda pokifyanka\nThe first word shows the genus, which is the group of species that are similar. The second word shows the specific epithet, which is the name of the species.\nOrganisms that are closely related are grouped into a genus.

However, the first argument is clearly stronger than the second, even though it is not deductively valid - while we're not sure Ben speaks French, there is a high probability he does. It seems that the people who have participated in the above threads argue that the difference in strength between these arguments is important. MIT's system makes such non-deductive inferences transparent. By evaluating the strength of the evidence for premises, and by testing counter arguments, people can grasp at a glance (or listen) how strong or weak the argument is, and how conclusions in an argument fit together to form a coherent position.

While some evidence suggests that cholinesterase inhibitors may improve cognitive function in certain individuals, there is also a growing body of research which indicates that these compounds can have adverse effects on cognition. In response to this challenge, we conducted a comprehensive literature review to gather evidence that sheds light on the potential side effects of cholinesterase inhibitors on cognitive function.\nOne of the key challenges of this review was the need to identify studies which investigated the effect of cholinesterase inhibitors on cognition without the influence of other neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. By excluding studies involving Alzheimer's patients, we were able to focus on the direct impact of these compounds on cognitive function. This approach has given us a clearer understanding of the potential adverse effects of these compounds, regardless of the underlying neurological conditions.\nFurthermore, our literature review also highlighted the need to consider the individual differences in the treatment response, and thus we also emphasized the", "token_ids": [279, 1614, 315, 386, 53945, 269, 323, 279, 3224, 650, 1910, 6347, 11, 1418, 816, 700, 285, 374, 7559, 304, 279, 1614, 315, 445, 10318, 710, 323, 279, 3224, 24218, 1347, 411, 285, 627, 791, 8712, 315, 3508, 523, 37737, 5302, 521, 61478, 11767, 311, 24629, 6372, 389, 75310, 706, 1027, 264, 3917, 315, 14529, 11249, 11, 449, 3892, 7978, 13122, 43561, 287, 31342, 13, 6104, 1063, 6029, 13533, 430, 523, 37737, 5302, 521, 68642, 1253, 7417, 25702, 734, 304, 3738, 7931, 11, 1070, 374, 1101, 264, 7982, 2547, 315, 3495, 902, 15151, 430, 1521, 32246, 649, 617, 31959, 6372, 389, 75310, 13, 763, 2077, 311, 420, 8815, 11, 584, 13375, 264, 16195, 17649, 3477, 311, 9762, 6029, 430, 77039, 3177, 389, 279, 4754, 3185, 6372, 315, 523, 37737, 5302, 521, 68642, 389, 25702, 734, 627, 4054, 315, 279, 1401, 11774, 315, 420, 3477, 574, 279, 1205, 311, 10765, 7978, 902, 27313, 279, 2515, 315, 523, 37737, 5302, 521, 68642, 389, 75310, 2085, 279, 10383, 315, 1023, 64908, 24673, 1778, 439, 44531, 596, 8624, 13, 3296, 44878, 7978, 16239, 44531, 596, 6978, 11, 584, 1051, 3025, 311, 5357, 389, 279, 2167, 5536, 315, 1521, 32246, 389, 25702, 734, 13, 1115, 5603, 706, 2728, 603, 264, 49479, 8830, 315, 279, 4754, 31959, 6372, 315, 1521, 32246, 11, 15851, 315, 279, 16940, 64908, 4787, 627, 57417, 11, 1057, 17649, 3477, 1101, 27463, 279, 1205, 311, 2980, 279, 3927, 12062, 304, 279, 6514, 2077, 11, 323, 8617, 584, 1101, 46728, 279], "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}]}, {"request_id": "1594", "prompt": "Grace lives in Fendrel.

For example, the genus Canis includes species such as the domestic dog (Canis familiaris), the gray wolf (Canis lupus), and the coyote (Canis latrans). All of these separate species share the smear body plan and therefore belong to the same genus. Each genus belongs to a larger category called a family.\nEvery organism can be classified by the following taxonomic categories:\nDomain - Eukarya\nPhylum - Cordata\nClass - Mammalia\nOrder - Carnivora\nFamily - Canidae\nGenus - Canis\nSpecies - Lupus Class is a taxonomic category that is more specific than the category of phylum, but more general than the category of order.

I believe that it is a bad argument because for an example: There are numerous people in Umbrithis who don\u00b4t even speak Hindi. People who speak Hindi aren\u00b4t necessarilly people who live in Umbrithis, and the same case happen with Luke and Balthorien. Ultimately, language is something that is taught and is a human dependency. It could be learnt by anyone. No matter where you live, you could speak any language of your choice. Language is something that cannot be confined by a specific place.

As the glaciers melt, water fills the land. Ice caps cover the North Pole and the South Pole. They also cover mountains like the Andes and the Himalayas. Ice caps are made of snow and ice. The ice absorbs heat from the sun. The heat causes the ice to melt. As the ice melts, it becomes water. The water fills the land around the ice caps. The water covers roads, buildings, and even entire towns. Global warming has many causes. One cause is greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gases are released into the air by humans.

Therefore, state Kryo has a parliament with representatives that are selected by the citizens of state Kryo and this parliament has legislative power.\nThis entry was posted in Content creation and tagged BMGEN136, chapter 7, Content creation, creating content on November 16, 2016 by 02828018.\nBecause I spend too much time online already it makes perfect sense to also add this course and its website, blog,", "token_ids": [2500, 3224, 1109, 14221, 805, 689, 627, 791, 1614, 315, 426, 1902, 269, 3675, 374, 21989, 555, 279, 11734, 666, 20110, 315, 507, 764, 404, 290, 323, 813, 3070, 13, 666, 20110, 961, 2094, 304, 279, 6037, 315, 279, 1614, 1606, 568, 374, 279, 11734, 315, 507, 764, 404, 290, 13, 578, 3224, 507, 764, 404, 290, 1587, 539, 617, 264, 21814, 1606, 279, 11734, 315, 507, 764, 404, 290, 6944, 311, 387, 279, 1193, 49080, 13, 15636, 11, 279, 1614, 315, 426, 1902, 269, 3675, 1587, 539, 617, 264, 21814, 627, 791, 11734, 315, 279, 3224, 816, 700, 285, 1587, 539, 636, 6532, 304, 279, 1614, 735, 97234, 6089, 13, 578, 1614, 735, 97234, 706, 813, 1866, 21814, 13, 578, 3697, 315, 279, 21814, 315, 279, 1614, 735, 97234, 649, 387, 4183, 555, 279, 10495, 315, 1614, 735, 97234, 13, 578, 21814, 315, 279, 1614, 315, 735, 97234, 1101, 706, 10383, 304, 279, 21814, 315, 279, 3224, 816, 700, 285, 13, 15636, 11, 1614, 735, 97234, 706, 264, 21814, 449, 24005, 430, 527, 4183, 555, 279, 10495, 315, 1614, 735, 97234, 323, 420, 21814, 706, 27743, 2410, 627, 2028, 4441, 574, 8621, 304, 9059, 9886, 323, 38213, 20387, 11332, 9795, 11, 12735, 220, 22, 11, 9059, 9886, 11, 6968, 2262, 389, 6841, 220, 845, 11, 220, 679, 21, 555, 220, 22000, 11209, 972, 627, 18433, 358, 8493, 2288, 1790, 892, 2930, 2736, 433, 3727, 4832, 5647, 311, 1101, 923, 420, 3388, 323, 1202, 3997, 11, 5117, 11], "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}]}, {"request_id": "1795", "prompt": "Joe lives in Glacidae.

As students expand into small groups, I will assign one student per group to be the recorder, another to be the speaker and others to be encouragers and reporters. The students will be placed in grade level appropriate groupings to perform the task.\nFor expansion, I will decide if students should expand using preprinted cards (two 10's and five one's cards for 15). The 10's and 1's are for the student to make connections between quantities and their names for each.\nTo introduce the lesson, I start with a brain-mapping activity. The students will be asked the following questions: What do you know about place value? What do you know about regrouping numbers?

The second fact, or the consequent, will always be true if the first fact, the antecedent, is true. If that is not the case, the implication is invalid.\nFor example, if a person is from a particular city, he or she would automatically be from that state or province. Similarly, if someone is from a state, he or she must be from that country, while if someone is from a particular country, he or she must be from that continent. In all of these examples, the second idea is a more general category than the first idea, and something cannot be part of the first category without also being part of the second.
